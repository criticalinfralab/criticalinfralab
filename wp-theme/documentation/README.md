Wordpress theme for criticalinfrastructurelab.net

## General

- CSS transforms all text to lowercase, so you don't have to bother doing it yourself unless you want to
- a click stops the drawing

## Homepage

- the page template calls the contents of the subpages
- the text below the logo can be edited on this main page

## Activities

- ordered anti-chronologically, sticky posts on top
- mark posts as "sticky" if you want them to appear on top of the list
- are blog posts
- add a category to each post
- if there is a video or a link to an audio or video recording, add the tag "has-recording"

## Publications

- ordered anti-chronologically (most recent on top)
- new publication: just add a new paragraph.
  - manually: type of publication / italic
  - manually: make title bold
  - manually: just link the title, not the entire parapgraph
  - manually: add CSS classes per paragraph using WP block interface (category-environment, category-standards, category-geopolitics, category-all, category-standards-geopolitics, category-environment-geopolitics, category-environment-standards)
    - or use the "reusable blocks" feature

## People and governance

- fellows + people: please do not change the markup (order of titles and paragraphs here)
- board members: it's simply a list of links.
