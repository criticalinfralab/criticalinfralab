*In this paper, I suggest one step further in the qualification of the dominant role of the private sector over the “rules” shaping how the internet functions. From corporate capture, I propose using the term of “corporate saturation” (Bartley, 2021) in reference to the multifaceted structural power gained by large companies over the internet standards-making process. It will be argued here that acknowledging evidence of saturation could help dislodge the still prevalent multistakeholder model of analysis and contribute to a more critical internet governance field.*  

The scholarship on internet policies often points to the great influence of technological companies in shaping norms and discourses, powered by their unrivalled lobbying budgets and unique control over digital infrastructures and consumers. Though the scale of their influence varies, some have become quasi-state actors, entertaining symbiotic relationships with actual states (Tréguer, 2019). The body of work on the feudalisation of the internet describes at length the power accumulated by private actors (Doctorow, 2023) and the resulting rise of a “private Internet governance regime” (ten Oever, 2021b), running an Internet more and more consolidated and centralized around the interests of a few. The increasing dependence of states upon the private sector is further described in the literature on “regulatory capture” in digital policies (Brown & Marsden, 2023), underscoring how companies can succeed in ensuring that state regulators predominantly defend private interests over public ones.  

As demonstrated by Cath (2023), internet technologies have become the “default infrastructure for society”. Within this infrastructure, internet standards are known to be the fundamental tools that allow the Internet to be a global, interoperable network of networks. While the internet governance literature often characterises as multistakeholder the organisations whose functions are to formulate and agree on internet standards (such as the Internet Engineering Task Force, IETF, and the World Wide Web Consortium, W3C), this paper challenges this framing by questioning the level of corporate saturation prevailing in those organisations and the implications for internet and its governance.  

### What does “saturation” mean?

While saturation is a polysemic word, with distinct meanings across scientific fields, it often refers to a state when the concentration of power and/or matter, and the underlying general laws that are associated with their rise/decline, are put to the limits. For instance, in the domain of electronics, saturation refers to the “state of a semiconductor device that is carrying the maximum current of which it is capable and is therefore unresponsive to further increases of input signal”. In the field of meteorology, the air is saturated when it hold as much water as it can for a given temperature. Drawing on this metaphor, and noting interestingly that clouds are known as “saturated portions of the atmosphere”, we will explore what this terminology may bring to the study of internet governance.  

This largely borrows from the work of Bartley (2021) and his illuminating piece Power and the Practice of Transnational Private Regulation. Using examples of private rules for land and labour, Bartley argues that the practice of private regulation can be said to be “saturated with corporate power” (Bartley, 2021). The seemingly pluralistic design of the multistakeholder organisations governing the formulation and implementation of land and labour rules is presented as hiding, not only the capture of intermediaries (certifications companies in this case), but the structural dependence of those governance systems on large companies, the direct and indirect effect of their practices and imaginaries for other actors, and ultimately their ability to make one's particular approach become “an unquestioned global norm” (Bartley, 2021). Thus, there seems to be merits in trying to transpose this notion to Internet standards-making, a field structured around a multitude of private consortia which we know to be increasingly consolidated around a few large technological companies (Cath, 2023a).  

### Manifestations of corporate saturation in Internet standards-making

In the field of internet standards, corporate saturation manifests itself in various ways, starting with the most visible, the overwhelming presence of corporate engineers among the membership and leadership of standards-developing organisations. From this predominance of corporate experts emanates an “exclusionary culture” documented in-depth by Cath (2021) in the IETF. Though recognising the intense power battles that companies often wage between themselves around standards, the general objectives of internet standard-developing organisations are in line with broad private interests, starting with the overall growth of the network. Aside from the actors and structure of standardisation processes, evidence of saturation can be conveyed by specific outcomes, such as HTTP/2 (Peacock, 2020) or the QUIC protocol (ten Oever, 2021a; Perarnaud & Musiani, forthcoming). Both cases highlight the capabilities of large technological companies in standardisation processes, while the very choice of Google’s initial brand name for QUIC is in itself another indication of the ethos that often prevails in Internet standards-setting.  

These observations show the value of using the framing of corporate saturation instead of capture. Indeed, capture suggests an overly active posture, where actors need to actively fight for, or protect, what they intend to secure (here, it would be their control over the formulation of norms). But what the case of internet standard-setting suggests instead is a model where corporate actors do not perceive this need, as they operate in a space primarily designed for the implementation of their vision of the internet, and whose corporate saturation seems to annihilate the advancement of alternative pathways.  

The concept of saturation can also help to go beyond rather consensual observations on the ongoing process of Internet consolidation, which is often solely assessed as a function of the control of a few companies over key segments of the Internet architecture. Instead, thinking in terms of saturation allows us to grapple with the ideational power of these corporate actors and its lasting effect on the imaginaries of public regulators, citizens, and importantly for the Internet governance field, academia.  

The recognition of this state of saturation does not suggest however that internet standards-making is characterised by only one (neoliberal) rationality (Flyverbom, 2011). When observing IETF processes, one will note the great autonomy that some experts may enjoy vis-à-vis their own corporate masters, or the genuine intellectual passion for the Internet that animates others. Multiple attempts to contest corporate stances can be observed, with their own contrasted rationalities, as illustrated for instance by the creation of the “Human Rights Protocol Considerations” research group of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which is specifically tasked with the mandate to assess whether protocols can enable or threaten human rights. But paradoxically, the very fact that such standard-developing organisation could allow compartmentalised contestation within their own core is illustrative of their relative control of the field as a whole. It illustrates yet again how “reputation-sensitive firms” tend to accommodate at the margins some civil society demands in standardisation processes, partly as a way to legitimise those processes and give them greater credibility (Graz & Hauert, 2019). This is further confirmed by the anthropologist Corinne Cath, who argues that “as open it may be”, the IETF remains a place “where corporate power rules” (Cath, 2023).  

### Addressing saturation in standards-setting

The current status quo for internet standard-setting, namely its predominant privately saturated industry-driven regime, falls short in terms of democratic accountability, legitimacy and inclusion (Perarnaud, 2024). Corporate saturation can be said to be one of the “dysfunctions and depredations of the modern internet” (Tarnoff, 2022) needing to be addressed; but how to do so remains the question. Though a strictly multilateral governance regime for internet standards is evidently not a desirable option (notably from a human rights standpoint), public regulators should support the emergence of a standardisation regime that is not saturated by a few multinational corporations.  

As we know, the internet is contingent (Pohle & Voelsen, 2022). It is the result of technological and political choices and imaginaries that, over the course of half a century, gradually shaped its structure and the affordances it grants to its users. But one could argue that the corporate saturation of Internet standards-making has the potential to transform “contingency” into “structural dependency”.  

Critical internet governance studies have an important role to play there. The resulting “corporate saturation of imaginaries” needs to be challenged by academia, notably by not blindly repeating the at times heroic discourses around internet’s multistakeholder governance. There is a need, instead, for more investment into the emerging body of work aiming at re-imagining the internet and what building internet infrastructures for the public good actually means (Mager, 2023; Cath, 2023).  

### Politics of citation

In this article, citations are distributed as follows: female names (5; 30%), male names (11; 64%), co-authorship female-male names (1; 6%). This gender disparity has been recognised and addressed as best as possible, while an additional effort was carried out to cite younger scholars – instead of only established figures within the field.
