> *“We have never been multistakeholder”*

In this position paper my main argument is simply that critical Internet governance should be telecommunications-aware, that is, account for telecommunications governance when tackling its core research questions and normative interventions.  I make this argument in three parts that have to do — in short – with the field, with the Internet, and finally, with the relationship of the two.

The **first argument** is about Internet governance as an academic field.  I argue that the interpretative power of Internet governance as an academic field is limited by its UN-conferred mandate of multistakeholderism.  Similarly its action potential is confined by the ideological framework of Internet freedom in which its US-funded audience operates.

The **second argument** is about the Internet and its governance, that is the subject matter of Internet governance as an academic field.  I argue that Internet and its governance is falling prey to the telecommunications industry and its governance mechanisms.  This is due to a development in the material conditions of the medium: the convergence between Internet and telecommunications.

The **third argument** is about Internet governance as a field and its relationship to the Internet and its governance.  I argue that now — as Internet governance as a field has reached the limits of its interpretative power and its subject matter have been contaminated by telecommunications — the field needs to work in an expanded critical framework beyond multistakeholderism and freedom, at the intersection of Internet and telecommunications.  The two issues of making Internet governance critical and accounting for telecommunications convergence are complementary.   The field inevitably encounters resistance when tackling the subject matter of telecommunications.  The breakdown foregrounds the hitherto unquestioned ideological assumptions of Internet governance scholarship and its normative interventions.  Living up to its original commitments demands at this historical moment to leave behind its inherited boundaries and revise its ideological allegiances.

I merely stated the main argument and its three corollaries.  In the following three sections, I flesh out the arguments, citing historical evidence on the development of the field itself (in section 1.), and then on the development of telecommunications (in section 2.), in order to deduce a research programme that can provide an appropriate response to the current historical situation (section 3).  I close with reflection on the politics of citation.

### Internet Governance

The first argument is about Internet governance as an academic field.  In my situated experience, the foundation moment of Internet governance was the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) process.  WSIS had two rounds, Geneva 2003 and Tunis 2005.  In the first round, I participated in the counter-summit called “We Seize” as part of the international Indymedia contingent.  The media centre was set up in an occupied theatre building.  We organised mass protest in line with the agenda of the Peoples’ Global Action (PGA) network.  We also conferred with civil society representatives and ambassadors of nations, and sometimes sneaked into the corridors of power inside the summit.  Above all, we reported on the developments in dozens of languages.  A collection of dispatches penned by my brother has been published in a Hungarian literary-political journal shortly after the summit.

In the second round, the same scene merged with civil society representation inside the summit.  I participated as a member of the Association for Progressive Communications (APC), representing the Green Spider Foundation, a Hungarian ISP that hosted the local Independent Media Centre (Indymedia node).  APC continued its campaign to organise and lead not just civil society, but also the non-aligned nations, against US hegemony on the one side, and the authoritarian positions pushed by some other powerful nations on the other side.  Since alter-globalisation style street-level protest was infeasible in Tunisia, the peripheral resistance was relegated to speeches at embassies that sought to highlight the dire circumstances of the local opposition.  In the meantime and on the inside, multistakeholderism quickly emerged as a key sticking point for APC.

Yet, APC did not come up with multistakeholderism.  I might not be familiar with the prehistory of the term, but it seemed to me at the time — as a twenty years old media activist — that the United Nations offered this “innovative” framework on its own accord.  It might have been a way to better accommodate competing interests in multilateral processes, and legitimise the extension of its authority to Internet governance bodies and standards organisations, many of which already practised it in different shapes and forms.  Of course, the real issue and the topic of the hottest debates have been about the manner of implementation.  My only publication in the Internet governance field, really, has been a blog post I wrote after the final consensus texts came out of WSIS 2005: *“Internet Governance is a trap”.*

Nothing to see here.  This was my moment for the “turn to infrastructure in Internet governance”, as the title of the edited volume by Musiani et al. announces.  It was published in 2016 — and appropriately, the storyline here fast forwards a decade.

In 2017, at the Internet Freedom Festival in Valencia, I got to learn about who produced and financed the resistance on the level of tools and tactics.  This was a meeting mounted with a colonial mindset where roundtables and workshops explored what I really thought was cutting-edge topics.  Spain had a very strong local hacker-activist scene and significant techno-political movements around the time, based on grass roots mobilisation and the self-valorisation of organic intellectuals.  Yet, local contributors and contexts have been conspicuously absent from the event, even if the festival featured an geographically diverse audience.  It turned out that Spain for the US-based organisers is a holiday location like any other, whose main offer is cheap hotels, good food and sandy beaches.  Within this enclave of the international vanguard, the future of the Internet has been discussed.

It took me a while to realise the real purpose of the event, which was to showcase projects ideas and demonstrate leadership qualities to the funders.  Apparently, the US state and civil society now mobilised international media activists to advance their foreign policy goals, projecting power, while maintaining plausible deniability.  Then, it made sense why to sidestep the local scene – since few of those people sought or received this kind of funding for their work.  I also learned which land the normative idea of freedom comes from.

The above are two examples where Internet governance scholarship and activism choose the *reformist* rather than the *critical* route.  What I mean is that many Internet governance scholars and activists embraced the framing of the issue – multistakeholderism here, Internet freedom there — as they encountered it at a historical junction.  They did not do that spontaneously or absent-mindedly, though.   They considered that going with the given frame of reference offered a reasonable chance to significantly improve the material conditions as they stood at the time.  After all, many of these people have been sophisticated organic intellectuals in their own right, political savvy and streetwise.  I am not to judge whether the reformist approach paid its political dividends over time.

My point is that it is striking how attempts to build alternative framings from a different base were washed out of these spaces of action and discourse.   Such base could have been  grassroots movements (like the PGA), material inventions (like community networks), or even progressive political philosophies (a new generation of “French philosophers” came to be discussed in English at the time, from Stiegler to Malabou).  Without reinventing Internet governance, I am simply trying to argue that a *critical* rather than *reformist* approach would involve identifying the limits of the current issue frames and dialectically overcoming them.  Since the UN governance mandate for multistakeholderism faded, and the US political-economical basis for advancing Internet freedom might be in jeopardy, it is a good time for critical governance scholars and activists to consider a critical approach to their subject matter.

### Telecommunications Governance

Meanwhile, in a galaxy far far away, where the cries of the resistance for Internet freedom have barely been heard, another technological civilisation have been in the making, based on different communications standards, cultural references and geopolitical configurations.  After all, it was not without a good reason that the designers and implementers of Internet Protocols sought to relegate power and intelligence to the edges of their networked universe.  They were well aware of the Bell Telephone Company that operated what was called the Biggest Machine in the World at the time.  The end-to-end principle and network neutrality served as a powerful disincentive for telecommunications engineers to meddle the waters of Internet governance.  The systems programmers who were building the global Internet were going to build a network for themselves and themselves alone, where the other caste of teletraffic engineers would have only the meagrest of roles to play — that is, to forward packets.  Packet switching worked out splendidly, and here was a connectionless protocol built from the ground up for digital communications.

Over the years, the hackers purged the last remnants of differentiated services and voice communications from their books.  These reminded them of the phone network, its idea of centralised control, and its privileging of the human voice.  The heretical second byte of the Internet Protocol headers were to be rendered apocryphal.  The phrases “Datagram priority”, “Quality of Service” and “Type of Service” — that the zeroes and ones in positions 8-15 stood for in their Internet Protocol headers — shall never be mentioned again.  Routers on the public Internet should ignore these bits for all intents and purposes.  Considering them would be tolerated only in private, on your own local networks.   Network Address Translation (NAT) would make sure to sanitise these bits, before blasphemous noises seep out onto the globally routed Internetworks.

However, the teletubbies would have none of this.  In the spirit of permissionless innovation, they have built their own network, with circuit switching and specialised protocols for carrying the human voice.  What is more, they even called it a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), challenging the well-publicised destiny of the Internet to bring about the global village through time and space compression.  While the world wide spread of the Internet have been driven by US-based entrepreneurship, it was European vendors, operators and standards bodies who dominated and championed telecommunications.  While Internet entrepreneurs kept innovating on the edges of their network, the mobile phone network was meant to evolve at its core.  That is how it could happen that it in a few generations of that telecommunications evolution, the network came close to bridge the digital divide, bringing global community to many more people than the pure IP based networks ever could.  While multistakeholderism experts worked the policy space, freedom technologists built encrypted chat protocols, community networks debated the benefits of the powerful B.A.T.M.A.N protocol over the antiquated OLSR, ^[That is, the routing protocols for multi-hop mobile ad hoc networks, the Better Approach to Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking and the Optimized Link State Routing Protocols, used in community networks.] telco companies delivered that last mile connectivity to vast underserved populations. — On their own terms.

The topology of telecommunications networks came to reflect the blueprint of colonial geography, since the European national champions recycled the remnants of European political and economic influence on postcolonial territories.  The WSIS rounds were the first UN summits to be organised on a multistakeholder basis, even under the aegis of the conservative International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the oldest international organisation on the planet.  Undisturbed, telecommunications governance and standardisation went on in the ITU for the next two decades, on a similar multilateral basis than on which it started in 1865.  That is, national delegations deliberate and decide on matters, without any space or mandate for other stakeholders.  Conversely, the bulk of the actual standards work happens in the Third Generation Partnership (3GPP), whose members come from standardisation organisations rooted in one of the nations with a strong telecommunications industry — and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute that sports members in five continents.  Where 3GPP standards fall short on the details, smaller and faster-moving industrial collaborations step in.  An emblematic one is the O-RAN Alliance, whose core members are telecommunications operators, while academic institutions and national research centres sit in a second tier with “contributors”.  In telecommunications governance, multistakeholderism has a very different meaning, and a ring that is hollow.

![Figure 1. “The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters”, aquaint by Goya, 1799.](media/Maxigas01.jpg){width="100%"}

*The sleep of reason produces monsters*, so goes the caption of Goya’s viral meme (Fig. 1).  The unreformed church of telecommunications has never had its share of protesters, festivals and global gatherings.  Cellular frequencies have never been a frontier to be defended.  Mobile networks were never broken, so nobody has to fix them.  An industry that recognised itself as such offered no illusions of democracy, neither disappointments.

It has been decades since Internet gurus have been preaching and Internet evangelists have been campaigning for the adoption of the next generation IPv6 protocol, to no avail.  Within that space of time, five generations of subsequent protocol *stacks* have been deployed by telecommunications service operators, largely without Venture Capital funding from Silicon Valley.  Why telcos and other teletubbies could achieve all this large-scale innovation in networking?  Paradoxically, because even under the hegemony of neoliberal political economic regimes, they have conceived of themselves as what Harold Sackman at Rand called *mass information utilities* that serve the public good, rather than digital platforms that serve innovation.  In that capacity, there have never been a question about their special treatment at the hands of governments and regulators when it came to state subsidies or international mergers.  They could build out, maintain and develop large scale communications networks by moving slowly rather than “moving fast”, maintaining backward compatibility rather than “breaking things”, planning with incremental innovations rather than “disrupting markets”.  A case in point is that now, when everybody and their grandparents have already moved to the cloud, and some companies are again considering on-premise deployments again, the cloudification of telecommunications begins as a trend with virtual Radio Access Networks.  That would be the first step towards platformisation, or in industry lingo, for telcos to become “techcos”.

And this is where the two storylines — about the Internet and telecommunications — converge.  Whether through Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), Network Function Virtualisation (NFV), network slicing or verticals, the higher complexity of the technology and the stronger organisational readiness of the operators means that at some point in time, Internet networks as we know them are absorbed into telecommunications networks.  Thus, telcos will be in charge of orchestrating data flows.  Despite the hype, AI/ML is just optimization — it is not where the structural transformation of media and communications happens today.  Cellular network operators are already the biggest Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in many countries, and Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) technology allows them to replace cables on the last mile with 5G connections deployed to the end user through plug-and-play devices that just need electricity.  Consumers will not necessarily consider whether their home routers are hooked up to a cellular modem or a fibre optic cable for uplink to the trunk lines.

Yet, these changes can be fundamental for everything that digital rights defenders, Internet governance scholars, or freedom technologists care about.  For a start, the centre of gravity of Internet governance and protocol standardisation is already moving to spaces, bodies and institutions ruled by telcos.  As mentioned before, these are not necessarily where multistakeholder governance models are popular, free software developers can participate, or what digital rights organisations can monitor.  Furthermore, the programmable, intelligent network architectures mean that harms can be harder to mitigate on the edge, and gains can be more difficult to realise.  A case in point is digital identity, which has been a sticking point in the debates between privacy advocates and their nemeses.  Emblematic Privacy Preserving Technologies such as Tor aim to hide the original IP address of users.  While complex proposals and cryptographic solutions exist for digital identity on the Internet, it has been part and parcel of telecommunications networks from their inception.  On an intelligent network, exposing such a digital identity based on subscriber identities on the Application Layer is trivial from a technical point of view.  It is being standardised as we speak in the CAMARA APIs, backed up by an industrial alliance led by Ericsson.  Finally, while the 5G rollout has encountered many obstacles on its way, it did ultimately achieve the status of a geopolitical fetish that nations use to measure up their positions in global power struggles.  It might be hard to dissuade them by references to principles like end-to-end or network neutrality.  As Fieke Jansen quipped, no use defending your mother’s Internet!

### Overcoming Internet Governance

The third argument is about the relationship between critical Internet governance and Internet infrastructure.  Do the original ideas about multistakeholder governance and Internet freedom make sense in a converged space of digital communication networks?  More pertinently, do the real political opportunities and political economic incentives that once underpinned these ideologies still hold?  If carriers are utilities, is that a new opportunity to campaign for their democratic governance?  If telcos rule the spectrum, is that solid ground to demand frequencies for community networks?  In more strategic terms, can internet governance scholarship — and the advocacy it is meant to support — stay ahead of the standardisation, implementation, deployment pipeline?  While these may not be the right questions to ask, the converged network surely begs more critical questions than what are currently asked about it.

In the meantime, can Internet governance scholars critically reflect on the conditions of emergence and the power dynamics of the very spaces where their inquiries play out?  Overcoming the limitations of the Internet governance disciplinary framework should include tackling the colonial legacies, postcolonial dependencies, gendered oppressions, and economic inequalities that allow for its reproduction.  Bringing the same kind of questions to the policy spaces and technical fora where network convergence is taking place at the moment would surely be a much more disruptive proposition than in nominally democratic institutions where participants can hide behind process, as Corinne Cath showed in 2023 in Loud Men Talking Loudly.  In essence, critical Internet governance is *critical* in so far as it can move beyond the themes, topics and ideological formations that it finds in the field, and bring to that field concerns from elsewhere — be that bodies of scholarship such as feminist technoscience or social movements such as climate justice.

Without critical scholarship and civil society weighting in, there will be few checks and balances in place for the future Internet, however it may turn out to be…

***

In conclusion, Internet governance as a field has reached the historical limits of its explanatory power and political potential.  The frameworks of Internet governance might not fit the infrastructural reality anymore.  There are three reasons for that.  First, the original architecture of the field has been tied to political opportunities that presented themselves in a particular historical moment, were already limited, and by now proved debilitating.  Second, the research object — e.g. the Internet itself — has been integrated into the larger history and sociotechnical regimes of telecommunications.  Third, the contradiction between the always already limited analytical framework of Internet governance and the expanding infrastructural reality of digital communication networks results in a growing discrepancy between research and object, theory and practice.  In response, critical internet governance should be an expanded field that takes into account the sociotechnical governance of telecommunications networks.

This is a personal-satirical essay, with the consequence that I am not making many explicit references.  There is a fare share of women authors, which really covers where I am taking my clues from.  Where the inbalance lies is in the geographical distribution: it is a very euro-centric perspective.  As someone who grew up in Eastern Europe, I would even say a Western European one.  Only those working in ex-coloniser nation states deserve a mention!

What I want to use this section for, is to point out that women and queer people played important roles in many of the scenes and movements mentioned in Section 1.  APC has been for a long time a consciously women-led organisation, many prominent personalities of the Freedom Festival are women, and the PGA had strong women in its organising committees.  Beyond gender binaries, the inventor of the B.A.T.M.A.N. protocol was queer.  There is surely more diversity to be found on the side of the resistance — while standards bodies and industry circles largely feature the proverbial loud, white men.  An exception to the rule is Dr. Chih-Lin, Chief Scientist of Wireless Technologies at China Telecom, who Chairs many key working groups in telecommunications standards development, such as the O-RAN Alliance And Future 5G/6G SIG.

<!-- While critical digital scholars rightly decry the “Platformisation of the Web” (as Anne Helmond put it in 2015), denouncing the Facebooks and Xs of the Internet as the gatekeepers of public debate, is it not the Content Delivery Networks like Cloudflare and the Tier 1 network operators like Lumen, Tata and Deutsche Telekom that take the ultimate decision about what constitutes a matter of public record?  While digital rights activists are rightly challenging the repression of file sharing networks and Torrent clubs, it is these operators that privately decide whether child pornography servers or Library Genesis gets global circulation.   -->
