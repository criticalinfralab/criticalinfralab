CEE, digital sovereignty, semi-periphery, organized hypocrisy  

This position paper problematizes the concept of EU digital sovereignty and the growing number of policies associated with it (Falkner et al, 2024) by drawing attention to Central and Eastern European countries’ role in these recent developments. In doing this, I draw on Sidney Rothstein’s work on the digital transformation in Europe’s Southern periphery, more specifically Portugal (Rothstein, 2023), on recent research on centre-periphery relations in EU’s new industrial policy (Lavery and Valença, draft), as well as on the mission statement of the newly established UACES research network “Rethinking Europe’s East-West Divide” (Rone, Gateva, Tudzarovska, 2024).  

The definition of CEE is contested, with some authors focusing mainly on the Visegrad Four, the Baltics, and the Balkans (Bohle and Grescovits, 2012), others including most former countries from the Soviet Block, and yet others expanding the notion from a geographical signifier to a conceptual one, as seen in the rise of the term “Global East” (Müller, 2018). Since this chapter deals with EU’s digital sovereignty ambitions, I discuss mainly CEE states that are part of the EU or applying to become part. I argue that looking at these states matters since it allows us to pose three crucial questions about EU digital sovereignty:   

First, whose digital sovereignty, pointing to the persisting inequalities within the EU and the lack of democratic legitimacy of new industrial policy in the digital field. Second, what types of strategic actions do CEE states engage in regarding EU’s pursuit of digital sovereignty? Third, what can the EU as a whole learn from the experience of the semi-periphery? I explore each of them in turn below.  

### Whose Digital Sovereignty? 

To begin with, I argue that a focus on CEE’s role in EU’s pivot towards digital sovereignty is crucial because it reminds us of well-known problems related to state capacity and the notion of sovereignty. Looking at CEE is important also because it reveals the slight-of-hand involved in generalizing the preferences of Germany and France (and occasionally The Netherlands and Ireland) as representing the whole of the EU. Not to mention that France and Germany, on the one hand, and the Netherlands and Ireland, on the other, often have vastly different visions of what European digital sovereignty should entail (Rone, 2024).  

While academia is becoming increasingly aware of Global North - Global South differences and attempting to bring voices from the Global South to the table, it is often forgotten that the Global North itself is far from a homogenous entity. Most CEE states have never been colonizers, some – like Russia - have been both a laggard semi-periphery and an empire with expansionary ambitions- and quite a few of them have for centuries been part of entities such as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Ottoman Empire (Müller, 2018; Doyle, 2013). In fact, when it comes to state capacity and the ability to drive digital transformation, CEE states are probably more similar to Global South states than to Global North ones such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, or the US.  

Thus, a potentially more productive way for analyzing the current pivot to digital sovereignty in the EU could draw on classic world-systems theory, which sees states as belonging to the core, semi-periphery or periphery of an integrated world-economy (Wallerstein, 1974; Lavery and Valença, draft). Indeed, despite the EU being a common political project and despite the presence of the single market (or rather precisely because of it), the EU is marked by striking inequalities, with countries such as Poland and Hungary clearly being integrated in German production systems in a semi-periphery role (Vukov, 2023), and countries such as Bulgaria and Romania with weaker state capacity being integrated mainly as markets for Western goods and as a source of a cheap labor.  

Structural interdependencies in mind, the question is: will the new investments in digital sovereignty in the EU shake or further perpetuate core-periphery divisions? Looking at investments in semiconductor chips in the EU under the Important Projects of Common European Interest instrument, Lavery and Valenca (draft) argue that such instruments in fact strengthen core-periphery divisions. In a similar vein, Zavarská et. al. argue that unlike Cohesion Policy instruments which aim to decrease inequalities between EU member states, “the uptake of EU industrial policy instruments rather appears to be a function of economic strength” (2023, 62). Even a cursory glance at organizational participation in Horizon 2020 projects by country until 2020 reveals that CEE states are significantly underrepresented (See Fig.1).

Ultimately, while division of labour within the former Soviet Bloc was a highly contested and explicitly political affair, with countries competing to position themselves as responsible for higher-added value industries (Petrov, 2024), this political battle in the EU remains more implicit, buried under the narrative of common industrial policy. Thus, it is more than ever crucial to ask: whose digital sovereignty are we talking about when discussing EU digital sovereignty?  

### Popular Sovereignty Sidelined? 

There is also a second key element to the question of “whose digital sovereignty”: EU citizens – both in the West and in the East - have not been consulted about the goals and conditions of new investments in digital sovereignty (Poitiers and Weil, 2022; Rone, 2024). The EU Chips act has been criticized not only for being untransparent but also for completely failing to impose “social, environmental, or redistributive conditions on the public subsidies granted to ensure they meet broader public goals” (Silva and Merk, 2024). And while corporate expansion has gone against democratic decision making in many Western European countries as well (Rone, 2024), disregard for transparency, democracy and citizen participation have sadly been particularly strong in semi-peripheral EU states as well as candidate memeber states.  

Considering the ongoing struggle against lithium mining in Serbia (Stefanovic, 2024), which is applying to become an EU member state, as well as recent contracts on lithium mining in Romania (Mining, 2024), it increasingly transpires that EU’s Eastern-most states are providing the underbelly of EU’s Digital Transition. CEE seems to be destined to be the location of mineral extraction that is not welcome in Western Europe (Zimmermann, 2023), as well as outsourced software development with little chance of developing domestic champions capable of competing at the EU, not to mention global level (Iliev, 2024). The current turn to digital sovereignty ultimately disregards democratic concerns, with CEE citizens’ democratic demands being sidelined by their own governments, Western corporations, and the EU alike. The EU digital sovereignty agenda emerges as serving not only a few Western states, but also as a corporate agenda above all.  

### CEE’s strategic interests in pursuing EU Digital Sovereignty

At the same time, the narrative so far presents CEE citizens and their governments as passive recipients of policies – doomed to be semi-peripheral, ignored, and stuck in low value-added industries.  

Against such overly pessimistic analyses, several political economists have argued that CEE states are not doomed to be relegated to the periphery of digital innovation. To the contrary, CEE countries could make use of new possibilities for state-aid and EU-wide financing and upgrade their economies, depending on state capacity and a strategic and realistic choice of industries to invest in (Hruby, 2024; Medve-Bálint and Šćepanović, 2019).  

What is more, the EU is not the only interlocutor of CEE EU member states. Partnership with the US or Russia/China has been incredibly important for countries from the region, performing a complex balancing act between competing hegemons. On the one hand, we have had Hungary’s Viktor Orban attracting investment from China. On the other hand, we have seen a rising Poland, which has traditionally had very strong geopolitical and security ties with the US. Poland has spearheaded its own regional project – the Three Seas Initiative, which encourages cooperation between thirteen EU member states allocated between the Baltic, Adriatic and Black Seas. The Three Seas initiative has been recognized by the US as a key opportunity to promote US interests (Kim, 2022), including US Big Tech interests. During the 2023 event “Digital Industries of the Three Seas Region”, for example, representatives of US tech companies questioned any attempt by the EU to achieve cloud sovereignty and develop EU champions capable of competing with the US (Digital Industry of the Three Seas Region, 2023). Still, against simplistic interpretations of Poland sabotaging the EU digital sovereignty agenda from within, we see that Polish companies have repeatedly made use of EU instruments such as the IPCEI, including when it comes to next generation cloud projects. Thus, Poland emerges not as a loser of EU digital sovereignty policies, as previous sections of this text might suggest, nor as an agent without stakes in it, but as a strategic player, navigating between the EU and the US, in pursuit of its own interests in the digital field.  

What is more, CEE countries often act in accord with each other in the digital field. Notably, all CEE countries are members of the so-called “liberally-like minded group” that pushes for more liberal digital policy and often supports the Netherlands and Ireland in their resistance against more stringent digital regulations (Perarnaud, 2021). CEE countries have also been among the staunchest critics of EU’s turn to new industrial policy, since they lack the fiscal space to invest in national/European champions and feel that such policies favour the bigger EU states (Bora and Schramm, 2024, 15). Ultimately, it is clear that attempts to achieve EU digital sovereignty cannot be understood without exploring the sometimes contradictory, sometimes coordinated moves of CEE players in the game.  

### We have never been Sovereign

The critique of EU’s pivot to digital sovereignty from a CEE perspective is a bit more than the ramblings of a disgruntled Eastern European, stating the obvious inequalities that still persist in the EU. In this final section, I argue that the experience of limited sovereignty of CEE (Bickerton, 2009) might in fact provide important insights for the EU in its attempt to catch up with the US and China. Could the limited sovereignty of CEE be a form of future past for the EU as whole? Drawing on Werner and de Wilde’s (2001) theorization of sovereignty as a speech act, it has been argued that actors make sovereignty claims precisely in situations of disputed or threatened sovereignty. So, is not EU’s digital sovereignty agenda precisely a recognition of failing sovereignty: the failing ability to exercise supreme authority over a territory? Has full-fledged sovereignty ever existed anyway? The idea that all states in the world system are sovereign has been labelled as a useful form of “organized hypocrisy” (Krasner, 1999)? Some states are surely more sovereign than other.  

In light of all of this, what can the EU as a potential future semi-periphery learn from its own current semi-peripheries? Or is it too rushed to presume that the EU and its core countries will lose the technological race with US and China? US corporations’ business strategy to address EU’s demands for digital sovereignty by providing “sovereign clouds” (Blancato and Carr, 2024), for example (no matter how unsatisfying these attempts are), show these corporations at least attempt to pay lip service to non-existing (yet?) EU digital sovereignty. Most CEE states have been so far deprived of these forms of polite hypocrisy.  

### Conclusion and Outlook 

To sum up, focusing on the role of CEE in EU’s digital sovereignty push is important not only because it problematizes superficial uses of the concept of sovereignty and reveals inequalities within the EU. It is important also because it reveals inner tensions within the EU, with CEE countries being less interested in (and capable of) developing domestic digital champions. At the same time CEE countries have actively invested in industrial upgrading and have often pursued their strategic interests by playing off the EU against other geopolitical actors such as China or the US. While in this position paper I outline why it matters to look at CEE, I hope in the future to develop a research programme that looks more specifically at 1) the relative role of domestic and foreign businesses in formulating national preferences – that is narratives of national interest - on digital policy in CEE, as well as at 2) the ability of CEE countries to influence EU-wide digital sovereignty policies and narratives. The (liberal) intergovernmentalist approach holds a strong promise to address the strategic interests and power inequalities involved in digital governance in our age of new state capitalism. It thus can make a substantial contribution to critical internet governance research.  

A colorful pro-diversity airport ad by HSBC recently drew my attention with the rhetorical question: “Is it better to have a point of view or a view of different points?”. Without overstating the pseudo-philosophical depth of airport billboards, I would argue: both are important. Looking at CEE is key not only to have some representation and diversity in academic research, but also because it allows us to see the cracks, breaks, and problems within the mainstream narrative of EU digital sovereignty.  

Paraphrasing Ostap Bender, the hero of the classic novel “The Twelve Chairs”: “the ice is cracking, gentlemen of the jury”. So is the notion of EU digital sovereignty. Indeed, rather than being a monolithic and unproblematic common strategy, EU digital sovereignty resembles more the cracked ice on a Sofia street – the result of a beautiful and clean first snow that has then melted, frozen again, melted again, and ended up as a cracked kaleidoscope of perspectives, past intentions, and futures non-realized.
