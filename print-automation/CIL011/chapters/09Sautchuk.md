### Introduction
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational contexts announce a new era of personalized and immersive learning experiences. These technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to adjust education to individual needs and engage students in innovative ways. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT and LLaMa (also commonly referred as Generative AI) are being increasingly utilized in educational environments to provide advanced interactive experiences (UNESCO, 2023). However, the ethical challenges they present, particularly concerning the reliability of AI-generated content, the protection of educational data and the dominance of AI technologies by big techs in the global North, necessitate a robust governance framework. This paper explores the potential benefits of AI in education, the associated ethical risks, and how Internet governance are expanding to intersect with AI Governance and address these challenges.

### Potential of AI in Education
AI technologies have transformative potential in education. AI can enable personalized learning experiences, adapting to the unique needs of students, including those with specific conditions such as autism. For instance, AI-driven platforms can analyze a student’s learning patterns and provide customized content that fits their pace and style of learning. This level of personalization can help bridge gaps in traditional educational methods, making learning more accessible and effective.  
Moreover, AI technologies like Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) can serve as interactive learning partners. ECAs can simulate human-like interactions, providing students with instant feedback and assistance, thereby enhancing engagement and motivation in the learning process.  
One of the widely used AI applications in education is chatbots. They have been applied in education, supporting activities such as teaching, learning, administration, assessment, advisory services, and are used across different educational domains and levels, with a strong focus on higher education (Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola, 2021; Paschoal, 2020). More recently, the launch of ChatGPT has elevated chatbots to an even higher level of importance, significantly impacting the learning process, enhancing college students' satisfaction with its interface while also inspiring a strong desire for continued use of the application (Yu, Yan and Cai, 2024).  

### Ethical Challenges and Risks
Despite their potential, AI in education raises significant ethical concerns. One of the primary issues is the reliability of AI-generated content. LLMs are known to generate plausible but inaccurate information, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." (Alkaiss & McFarlane, 2023; Minaee et al., 2024) This poses a serious risk in educational contexts, where students could rely on AI-generated content for learning. Many students and even teachers may not fully understand the limitations of these technologies, mistakenly assuming that the information provided is accurate and factual.  
Furthermore, the use of AI in education raises significant concerns about data privacy, security, data retention, algorithmic bias, and plagiarism, along with risks of overreliance that may reduce students’ autonomy and self-efficacy (Williams, 2024; Huang, 2023). The educational data used to train AI models often includes sensitive information about students, many of whom are minors and lack the knowledge to provide informed consent. Misuse of this data can lead to serious privacy violations.  
Another concern is geopolitical dominance through education and technological innovation (Nemorin et al., 2022). It is a fact that AI technologies are dominated by big tech companies in the U.S. and China, which raises questions about equitable and culturally sensitive deployment in educational technologies. These technologies often fail to consider the diverse cultural contexts of students in the global South, leading to ineffective learning experiences and exacerbating educational inequalities. This concentration also reinforces a power imbalance, underrepresenting the needs and voices of the global South in the creation and governance of these technologies.  
Finally, the question of accountability also arises: who is responsible when AI-generated educational content is incorrect or misleading? All those issues extend beyond technical challenges to governance, highlighting the need for clear policies and ethical guidelines.  

### Expanding Internet Governance to Intersect with AI Governance
Internet governance and AI governance are becoming more interconnected, since AI systems become increasingly integrated into Internet-based services as well as both address the regulation, ethical implications, and management of technologies that are fundamental to modern digital infrastructures. While Internet governance focuses on the policies, standards, and regulations that ensure the accessibility, security, and fairness of the global internet, AI governance extends these considerations to the development and deployment of artificial intelligence systems. The governance of AI often intersects with Internet governance in areas such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and ethical standards, given that AI systems rely on vast amounts of data that are generated, shared, and processed over the internet. Harmonizing governance across Internet and AI domains is essential to address common challenges related to transparency, accountability, the protection of user rights, among others.  
Just like Internet governance, AI governance can be understood through the lens of polycentric governance, which operates across regional, national, and local levels in a trans-scalar manner. It involves a dynamic mix of governmental, commercial, and civil society actors, often collaborating in multi-stakeholder institutions, presenting the trans-sectorality characteristic. Particularly in AI governance, the regulatory frameworks are constantly evolving through the emergence of new bodies and adjustments to existing structures. This results in overlapping mandates, unclear precedence among regulatory bodies, and contested lines of authority. Moreover, polycentric governance lacks a central decision-making authority, making AI governance a continuously adaptive and decentralized process (Scholte, 2017). According to Xue (2024), the attributes of polycentricity in the emergence of AI are first seen in the diverse definitions used to describe AI, ranging from big data and data analytics to deep learning, across various communities such as scientific, regulatory, and corporate sectors, with a second aspect being the multiple centers of policy discourse and authority, where big companies have rapidly taken the lead in the conversation on ethical and responsible AI. This quick movement aimed to shape the discussion in a way that guarantees the interests of the big companies in this field.  
Although both Internet and AI governance can be viewed from a polycentric perspective, there is a significant power imbalance between the various power centers seeking prominence among world that is not fully captured in this approach. There are current efforts towards more inclusion of the Global South in AI governance processes, however it is clear that it is just a first step of a long effort towards institutional reform that allows for adequate distribution of agenda-setting, decision-making, and resource power, as well as accountability (Png, 2022). In the case of Internet governance, the ecosystem is already more mature, yet it is still possible to observe that even after years and numerous actions, power inequities persist. In the current moment, the balance tends to be disproportionately in favor of countries in the Global North and big tech companies in both Internet and AI governance.  
In the education sector, there is growing concern among institutions about the use of AI, leading to the creation of AI usage guidelines, such as those developed by the Big Ten Universities, the oldest collegiate athletic conference in the United States (Wu, Zhang and Carroll, 2024). Additionally, 25 states in the US, along with their departments of education, have established official guidance or policies regarding the use of AI in K-12 schools (AI for Education, 2025).  
Both Internet and AI governance through the lens of polycentricity rarely considers educational institutions, particularly K-12 schools, as key actors in the decision-making process. While universities are sometimes involved in those governance discussions, their participation is typically limited to the research and development agendas. Educational institutions play a direct role in shaping the future of AI and its ethical use, yet they are often excluded from the broader governance conversations where important decisions about AI’s societal impact are made.  
Considering this scenario of polycentric AI governance and Internet governance and the reality in which educational institutions are poorly included in high-level decisions, the question that arises is: how can we build a more inclusive governance?  

### Bringing educational institutions closer to polycentric AI and Interne governance
At first glance, polycentric governance may give the impression of disorder or chaos. However, Koinova et al. (2021) argue that polycentricity works because of norms, micro-patterns of practice, and macro-frameworks of social structure. Considering this, an effective approach to integrating educational institutions into the more established structures of polycentric Internet and AI governance—and fostering mutual recognition—is to identify and build upon their shared norms, micro-patterns of practice, and macro-frameworks.  
Koinova et al. (2021) says that “norms are general articulated principles that inform the process of governing.” Democracy, economic growth, gender equality, human rights, peace, rule of law, sovereignty, sustainable development, transparency, and accountability are examples of such norms. While many of these norms are shared across educational institutions and AI and Internet governance structures, it is important to reflect on whether they are understood and applied in the same way within each community. Differences in interpretation and implementation may shape governance dynamics, requiring dialogue to bridge potential gaps and foster more inclusive and effective governance frameworks.  
Another layer of structure in polycentric governance, underlying orders (or macro-frameworks of social structure), is systemic, permeating all locations and connections in a polycentric regime. Koinova et al. (2021) identifies key aspects such as the hegemonic leadership of the leading government, capitalism, and techno-rationalism as underlying orders. While similar underlying orders may influence Internet and AI governance and educational institutions, it is essential to reflect on whether these orders enacted in the same way across those different communities. Variations in interpretation and emphasis could lead to divergent priorities and decision-making approaches, highlighting the need for deeper engagement and dialogue to align governance structures while respecting the distinct needs of each domain.  
The last type of structure in a polycentric mode of governance concerns practices—what people do either tacitly or unconsciously. According to Koinova et al. (2021), practices can be classified into four dimensions. The first dimension encompasses routines, words, phrases, and narratives, shaping the discursive aspects of governance. The second, referred to as behavioral dimensions, relates to routine forms of bodily interaction. The third dimension, the material aspect, relies on objects as shared reference points within a polycentric governance framework. The last dimension covers the institutional aspects of practice, including how organizations build and execute their policy processes.  
It is within this structural layer that the most significant differences emerge between educational institutions and AI and Internet governance. Education governance is traditionally rooted in local and national frameworks, shaped by long-established pedagogical traditions and deeply ingrained institutional cultures. In contrast, AI and Internet governance operate on a more international scale, evolving through agile, tech-driven approaches influenced by global market forces and rapid technological advancements. The ways in which policies are crafted, decisions are made, and interactions unfold can differ significantly across these domains. Recognizing these disparities is essential to fostering meaningful collaboration and ensuring that educational institutions are not merely adapting to external governance models but actively contributing to AI governance in ways that align with their core missions and values.  
Integrating educational institutions into the polycentric AI and Internet governance structures does not imply replacing specific forums dedicated to AI in education or educational spaces that discuss AI alongside other educational topics with a more general governance framework. These forums should continue to exist, as they are essential for addressing domain-specific and region-specific issues. Rather, the goal is to map their existence and recognize their value within the broader polycentric Internet and AI governance framework. This approach would be a crucial step in enriching the entire AI ecosystem.  

### Conclusion
The integration of AI into education presents both transformative opportunities and critical governance challenges. While AI has the potential to enhance personalized learning, support diverse educational needs, and improve administrative efficiency, it also raises ethical concerns related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the concentration of power among a few dominant tech companies. As AI governance continues to evolve alongside Internet governance, educational institutions must play a more active role in shaping policies that align with their pedagogical values and societal responsibilities.  
A polycentric governance model offers a useful framework for understanding the intersections between AI, the Internet, and education. However, despite shared norms and structural similarities, governance practices in education differ significantly from those in AI and Internet ecosystems. Education governance has historically operated within national and local frameworks, whereas AI and Internet governance function on a global scale, driven by market forces and rapid technological change. These differences highlight the need for greater collaboration, ensuring that educational institutions are not merely passive recipients of AI policies but active contributors to governance discussions.  
To build a more inclusive Internet and AI governance framework, it is crucial to recognize the existing forums where educators and policymakers engage in discussions on AI in education. Rather than replacing these spaces with broader governance structures, efforts should be made to map their contributions and integrate them into the larger Internet and AI governance ecosystem. This approach would help bridge gaps in understanding, foster cross-sector collaboration, and promote governance models that are both effective and equitable.  
Ultimately, ensuring the ethical and effective use of AI in education requires a governance structure that acknowledges the distinct needs of educational institutions while fostering alignment with the broader digital ecosystem. By engaging in dialogue, leveraging shared norms, and addressing disparities in governance practices, it is possible to work toward a future where AI serves as a tool for educational empowerment rather than exacerbating existing inequalities.
