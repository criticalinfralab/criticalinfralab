Internet governance, decolonial thought, critical pedagogy  

In this short essay, my intent is to mobilize some critical pedagogy thinking to reflect on internet governance (IG) in order to illuminate the silences and blind spots that constitute this field of knowledge. Can we collectively “research back” (Smith, 2021) IG?  

My first contact with a computer occurred in 1989, when I was in the 3rd grade in a public school in São Paulo. Paulo Freire, a critical pedagogy thinker and activist, was starting as the secretary of education in that that is the largest city of Brazil, after the invite of the first woman to govern the city, the Workers Party mayor Luiza Erundina. Freire’s project was to design a popular education program “whose main traits [were] joy, seriousness in appropriating and recreating knowledge, class solidarity and love, curiosity and question” (Freire, 1989, p. 1). Although computers were already in use in some schools in the city since 1986, Freire expanded their presence and launched the Projeto Gênese (Genesis Project) centered on Logo, a programming language in which students learned how to easily program geometric drawing with the help of an unforgettable turtle cursor. Logo was designed back in the sixties, in the United States, by the computer scientists Wally Feurzeig, Cynthia Solomon and the constructivist education scholar Seymort Papert, the founder of MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (today MIT CSAIL). It was translated into numerous languages across many different regions and became a popular tool in educational systems eager to help children’s appropriation of new technologies, from Brazil to Japan (Logo Foundation, n.d.; Secretaria Municipal de São Paulo (SME), 2024).  
What would be necessary for this story, which precedes the internet as we know it, to become a matter of internet governance (IG)? Our guess is that, considering the field interest in technology architecture, coordination, and policy,[^2] questions of property, national borders, design and policy decisions could more easily find its way into this literature, while the people, e.g. the students, would likely be left out of the problematization. Concerned with power dynamics at the level of states, institutions, corporations, and infrastructure, IG scholarship has been known for its technical writing, and, certainly, not for being a literature that focuses on users or regular people. We enjoy talking about “technopolitics,” a keyword in science and technology studies (Hecht, 2011), but the Politics that happens at the moment of use, domestication (Matassi et al., 2019; Silverstone & Haddon, 1996), and appropriation of technologies seems to have a secondary role, overshadowed by approaches shaped by political economy analyses. **It is difficult to disagree that IG has rarely been an area that ignites our dreams and liberatory thoughts.**  
At the same time, it is common that scholarship concerned with the relationship between digital technologies and the people does not self-classify as IG or is not recognized as such (e.g. Broussard, 2019; McIlwain, 2019; Noble, 2018; Ricaurte Quijano, 2024), with exceptions coming from a dialogue with human rights (e.g. DeNardis & Hackl, 2016, on the DNS mediation of queer rights; ten Oever, 2021, on the routing system role in human rights mediation) and Indigenous knowledges (e.g. Rosa, 2023, on the internet co-design labor of Tseltal and Zapoteco people). A similar phenomenon occurs with researchers of technology and the environment (Cooper, 2021; Mukherjee, 2020).  
I would like to be part of a field where we can dream. Where we can expand the understanding of what governance is, both acknowledging the role of the ones who are absent of the traditional governance arenas and subverting the capital and extractive-oriented purposes of the traditional actors that occupy these spaces. For the internet to work, ICANN, IETF, ITU, GAFAM, US and China governance occurs parallel to the governance of ordinary people, including Indigenous people; and nonhumans, including the environment, the trees, the mountains, and numerous artifacts, such as code (Rosa, 2022, 2023). Dreaming requires to build a space of hope, where the goal is not only to analyze what exists, but to imagine what does not seem to be possible yet. It also requires recognize Indigenous people as internet co-designers, who along mountains, trees, lights and storms need to be considered internet governance actors.[^3]  
Critical pedagogy, Black, feminist, Indigenous, and decolonial literature all point to spaces of less hierarchy and more distributed dialogues, but when it comes to IG, rooted in institutionalist approaches, most of our field end up reproducing hierarchical models. The use of our technical knowledges to support existing counter hegemonic movements is still scarce. I am thinking of a field of IG away from resignation and closer to transformation intents. As Paulo Freire reminds us:  
*When a word is deprived of its dimension of action, reflection automatically suffers as well; and the word is changed into idle chatter, into verbalism, into an alienated and alienating "blah." It becomes an empty word, one which cannot denounce the world, for denunciation is impossible without a commitment to transform, and there is no transformation without action.* (Freire, 2005, p. 87)  
 At the same time, it is hard, and maybe necessary, to recognize what the critical pedagogy scholar and activist Peter McLaren states when reflecting on information technologies:  
*We are... trapped into becoming activists for types of cultural change that are dependent upon the very corporations that we rail against instead of becoming agents for transforming existing social relations of production so that they will help to produce both the systems of intelligibility and the durable, concrete infrastructure necessary to help populations meet their needs.* (McLaren & Jandric, 2020, p. 37)  
So, what are some of the things that we can do? One possibility is to join people with whom we can think with. People whose scholarship we admire and who we recognize is expanding what IG is. And if a sense of belonging to the field of IG does not exist among these people, should we nurture it? Should we shape a parallel network?  
Another possibility is to reflect on how we can “research back” IG. Researching back is a decolonial approach proposed by Linda Tuhiwai Smith, who, reflecting on academia, states that “[i]n a very real sense research has been an encounter between the West and the Other” (Smith, 2021, p. 8).  In this encounter, academic knowledge is marked by erasures, which have been increasingly denounced and disputed in multiple areas.  *Researching back IG means to shed light on its silences, foregrounding peoples, knowledges, practices and geographies, which, for different reasons, have been neglected of IG arenas.* For example, what can we do... to include other voices in IG?... to rethink internet architecture based on people’s right to communicate instead of corporations’ and government’ thirst for more surveillance?... to learn from below? (Harding, 2008). Is it possible to see Freire’s values, from joy to solidarity, reflected within IG? And what are the other questions that we feel that need to be responded?  
I am writing from a place of hope and optimism; a place where there is no belief that we will “change the world,” given that reproducing imperialist and diffusionist models has never been beneficial to my people in Latin America and the global South. My hope is that we can find a community with similar goals to collectively create forms to repurpose IG, with the commitment to support transformative actions on the way.  

### Citation Diversity Statement
Through this declaration, we join a collective effort to undo the structural epistemological erasure in academia against women, genderqueer people, Black people, people from the global South, and other social groups, whose voices are less heard due to bias in citations. We believe that transparency in relation to our bibliographies is essential to understand the present, and to change this structural condition in a joint and consistent way. In this paper, citations are distributed as follows: female names (10; 40.0%), male names (9; 36.0%), female-male names (3; 12.0%), and institutional sources (3; 12.0%).
