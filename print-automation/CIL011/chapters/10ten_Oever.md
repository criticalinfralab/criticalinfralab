internet infrastructure, internet governance, telecommunications, futures  

In this short essay, I explore whether widespread discontent with the current Internet can lead to a new Internet and a new field of Internet governance studies. I will do so by first introducing the issue, then offering three issues where current networks should be improved, and concluding by offering pathways for future internets and connected research.  

<p class="section">The Return of the Same</p>

The contemporary discomfort with the Internet is very similar to the discomfort felt about telecommunication networks by the end of the 1980s. There were large corporations that dictated the usage of 'their' networks by customers, provided little flexibility, and were bastions of communication power. The resurgence of this discomfort might not be a coincidence because with the emergence of 5G, the Internet and telecommunications have technologically fully merged. Similarly, the patterns of large incumbent providers that hamper rather than harness real social innovation have repeated. The discomfort with the lack of configurability in telecommunications networks significantly contributed to the development of the Internet (Zittrain, 2006; Van Schewick, 2012; Clark, 2018). This then begs the question: what are we going to build next?  

The excitement about the early Internet is long gone. Even the most staunch defenders of the multistakeholder model have acknowledged that influence from civil society was mainly fictional (Hofmann, 2020) and was always already part of a power play for the Internet (Carr, 2013, 2015). So, where do we go from here? Let us take some lessons from the Internet and telecommunications governance and move on. Even if this means we probably will make mistakes, at least they will be the mistakes that characterize a different time, which might inspire the generation of networks after that in a similar way to what previous networks have done before (Choudhury, 2010; Yang, 2011; Mailland & Driscoll, 2017; Kerssens, 2020; Petrov, 2023).  

<p class="section">How does it (not) work?</p>

The first transatlantic telegraph cable functioned for only three weeks (Standage, 1998; Gordon, 2003; Schwartz & Hayes, 2008). The first message sent over the Internet in 1969 crashed halfway (Cath, 2021). The Internet works – and breaks – in mysterious ways (McKelvey, 2018). It has become commonplace in Science and Technology Studies to cite Susan Leigh Star, who writes that 'the normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout' (Star, 1999). However, I argue that it is not the infrastructure that becomes visible in an apparent outage; everyone who works with it knows that it breaks down all the time, but our expectation of infrastructure becomes visible upon breakage.  

Communication infrastructures have become so commonplace in our information societies that we do not ask how they work but accept them as a given, as 'common sense'. This is why Maxigas and I suggest using the concept of ideology to explain the ordering that infrastructure provides to society (Maxigas & ten Oever, 2023), because – as Keller Easterling writes – 'changes to the globalizing world are being written, not in the language of law and diplomacy, but rather in the language of infrastructure (Easterling, 2014). So, if we want to understand changes in society, we should appreciate the ordering material infrastructure provides to it.  
Suppose infrastructure is important in information societies and the globalizing world. In that case, these networks should be knowable to a general audience, researchers, and experts. But with the Internet and telecommunications, the opposite is happening. It becomes harder to understand how the networks work (Aboba et al. 2007, 49). This is the first thing that needs to change for a future network.  

<p class="section">Who does the work?</p>

If we want to know how the network functions, we should know who we can ask how it works. Therefore, who operates networks and handles our data streams should be transparent. Historically, the development of communications networks has been a continuous tussle over control over data streams. Many different vectors of control have been deployed, ranging from territorial control (Zajacz, 2019; Haggart et al., 2021), control over mediums such as cables (Starosielski, 2015), airwaves (Mukherjee, 2020; Manner, 2022), modes of governance (DeNardis, 2014), ways of message encoding (Langlois, 2006; Berry, 2011; Cox, 2013), and the deployment of encryption (Landau, 2007; Ermoshina & Musiani, 2019; ten Oever, 2021). These means have been asserted to wrestle control over data streams from the hands of either network operators by content providers or by nation states from either of them. And, of course, by the peers of these actors. However, citizens, or infrastructure users, are always at the end of these conflicts. The citizen is not an actor itself but rather a product, the prey that is hunted, the source to extract information from, or subjectivity to be produced by the network. The network does not present itself as configurable but only as inescapable configuring actors. Citizens should be able to pull away the curtain and see the actors that run communication infrastructures, what they do, and how they do it.

<p class="section">Is there an off switch?</p>

The Herman Melville character 'Bartleby, the Scrivener' (2017) one day responds to every single request that is made to him: 'I would prefer not to'. Even though this, in the end, costs the character his life, this act can be interpreted as a fundamental interrogation of the possibility of freedom and sovereignty. Refusal is a tactic to showcase patterns of power and governance, something which has also been argued by Michel Foucault in several of his lectures (Cadman, 2010). Translated to the field of Internet infrastructure and communication networks, this could be interpreted that to be able to understand how the Internet can be governed; we should be able to distance ourselves from the infrastructure and networks because else we will never be able to relate ourselves to them. If the Internet really, as Laura DeNardis argues, does not have an off switch (2020), then it is crucial that we at least can distance or disconnect ourselves from the network. The fact that this is already very hard to imagine in the current world, especially with all our digital representations being inherent parts of databases, archives, and logs, makes it crucial to argue for the ability to disconnect. In her recent book, Catherine Malabou engages in a revaluation of anarchism because private property has taken such a central place in our societal ordering, and according to Malabou, anarchism is the only theory that structurally problematizes this (Malabou, 2023). Malabou's approach might be similarly productive to the Internet because dis-connectivity might teach us more about connectivity than multistakeholder governance currently does.

<p class="section">Where is the on switch?</p>

The ability to 'prefer not to' should not be seen as a disconnect from the possibility of saying 'yes' to networks, connecting, and producing connectivity. Rather, it is the way to come to an understanding or a relational mode, an infrastructural ideology if you will, that is not one that is given but rather one that is produced. One over which one has understanding and ownership. This practice is often obtained through practices of 'transgressive infrastructuring' (Wagenknecht & Korn, 2016). It is called this because infrastructures are often not meant to be operated by individuals, and therefore, individuals are not only locked out of the knowledge of how networks work but also the expertise of running them. This inevitably leads to oligopolization, where knowledge of the operation of infrastructures is captured by the only ones who are producing and operating the network. This is problematic if we choose to run information societies on communication infrastructures because it would make democratic oversight impossible. 
<p class="section">How can we change it?</p>

Already in 2017, the book 'I Hate the Internet' (Kobek, 2017) was published, but somehow, it seems that it did not receive a wide authorship among Internet governance scholars. The field of Internet governance seems highly preoccupied with the functioning of so-called I* organizations, the role of governments, and cybersecurity. But there is no space to ask the question: What is the Internet we want? Or maybe more carefully: Where did the Internet go wrong? Or a bit more self-reflective: What did we fail to see, recognize, and act upon?  

<p class="section">Who do we want to be?</p>

Internet governance studies should not merely try to describe the minutiae of how the governance of the Internet works and leave the discussion of power and possibility to the historians of science and technology. Internet governance studies has a potentially crucial task to play in uncovering how the Internet has become what it is today, where it went wrong, how it can be done better. If internet governance is not ready to live up to this task or is not interested in it, then we need a new critical internet governance. Maybe that new field can give rise to new infrastructural futures and the infrastructural ideologies to make them happen.  

<p class="section">Politics of citation</p>

Of the first authors I cite in this paper, 20 (54%) self-identify as women and 17 (46%) as men. The overwhelming majority are from and working in Western Europe and North America. This shows that while gender diversity is increasing in my field and my reading list, we still have a lot of work to do before we arrive at an honest global discussion about internet governance.
