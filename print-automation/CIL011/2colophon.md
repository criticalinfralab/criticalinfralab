“Critical Internet Governance: From Positions to a Field”. Report of workshop organised by the critical infrastructure lab and the Research Network on Internet Governance (REDE). The workshop served as a preconference to the 2024 joint annual meetings of the European Association for the Study of Science and Technology (EASST) and the Society for the Social Studies of Science (4S). We are thankful for all participants for their collaboration at the workshop and during the peer review process. We are especially grateful for Maya Richman for facilitating the workshop.
