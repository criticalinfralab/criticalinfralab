# Executive summary 

The European Union invests significant amounts of public money in
digital research and innovation and has made steady progress in digital
transformation over the decades. At the same time, people, businesses,
and institutions in Europe remain heavily dependent on digital services
and products provided and controlled by non-EU corporations. Rising
geopolitical tensions and shifting alliances have made the precarious
position this creates for Europe increasingly clear. Digital sovereignty
is high on the EU's agenda. This report analyzes the European Union\'s
approach to funding digital technology research and innovation, focusing
on the allocation of resources under the Digital Europe and Horizon
Europe programs. It situates this analysis within the broader landscape
of EU technology policy, its reliance on digital innovation for economic
competitiveness, and the ambition to maintain -- or perhaps rather,
achieve -- technological sovereignty. Based on our analysis, we draw the
following conclusions and recommendations.

## Key findings

1.  There is an overreliance on the potential and promise of
    "disruptive" technologies. The EU\'s funding strategies are heavily
    influenced by the idea that breakthroughs in AI, quantum computing,
    and other emerging fields will be a silver bullet that will turn
    things around for Europe's competitiveness.

2.  The approach to R&I funding is technology-centric rather than
    need-centric. Funding for digital innovation remains overwhelmingly
    focused on developing new technologies ("digitization for the sake
    of digitization") rather than addressing well-defined,
    evidence-based needs and solving problems ("digitization as a means
    to an end").

3.  Funding agencies fall for tech hype. EU funding programs often
    reflect industry-driven narratives about new technologies and their
    potential. This approach lacks critical rigor and analytical nuance
    in assessing the actual potential of different technology areas.

## Recommendations

1.  ***Prioritize Public Digital Infrastructure (PDI)*** --- EU funding
    should strengthen public digital infrastructure rather than chase
    disruption. It should ensure that publicly funded digital tools
    serve the public interest. Development, maintenance and repair of
    PDIs delivers value to the whole of society and contributes to
    competitiveness in humble but reliable ways.

2.  ***Align industry support with public interest*** --- EU funding
    decisions in support of industry should be guided by the imperative
    of meeting public needs. The aim should be to increase individual
    and collective autonomy. State participation in shaping markets can
    serve to correct for market failures only if it is oriented towards
    different incentives than private investors.

3.  ***Adopt a more critical approach to technology investments*** ---
    Decision-makers should move beyond techno-deterministic and
    techno-optimistic narratives and take a more critical approach to
    assessing technologies.Evidence-based, strategic and mission-driven
    investment can control for risks inherent in pursuing research and
    innovation.

# Introduction 

In January 2025, fearing that the new U.S. administration might impose
sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC), including banning
American companies from doing business with the Court, ICC officials
began reviewing their suppliers and cutting ties with certain service
providers to reduce risk. As reported by the Guardian, prosecutors
admitted that nearly all of the court\'s evidence was stored in the
cloud, in this case, Microsoft Azure.[^1] ICC\'s reliance on
Microsoft\'s Azure cloud platform meant that any downtime, be that a
technical blunder or a politically motivated suspension of services,
effectively bring investigations to a halt. The independence of the
court is thus effectively curtailed by the infrastructural dependencies
necessary for its operation.

This case reflects a far more profound and pervasive issue affecting
individuals, businesses, and institutions worldwide. For all its
regulatory zeal, the European Union (EU) is no exception. Over the last
decades, the EU has advanced its digital transformation, yet the bloc
still relies heavily on digital services and products provided and
controlled by non-EU companies. While the EU prides itself on the
openness of its markets,, rising geopolitical tensions and shifting
alliances have shown how risky a reliance on foreign digital
technologies may quickly become.

In March 2024, the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) determined
that the Commission\'s use of Microsoft 365 breached EU data protection
laws, particularly regarding the transfer of personal data to non-EU
countries.[^2] According to Euractiv, internal documents reveal that
Commission officials are apprehensive about their dependence on
Microsoft and raise questions about the security and privacy of the
data.[^3] Let\'s imagine for a moment that sanctions similar to those
feared by the ICC were imposed on EU institutions! What would be the
consequences? And what would it say about Europe\'s technological
sovereignty?

This report examines the European Union\'s approach to funding digital
technology research and innovation. It wants to uncover the explicit and
implicit motivations and priorities behind funding decisions. It reviews
publicly available data on two EU funding programs, Digital Europe and
Horizon Europe, to analyze how resources are allocated. The report looks
at the work programs of both funding schemes. It consists of two parts:
Part I, which is narrative, and Part II, which includes additional
analysis of quantitative data. To analyze the allocation of funding
within the Horizon program, the authors used the *project, organization*
and *euroSciVoc* datasets provided on the open-source European Data
portal[^4] and scraped the CORDIS website.[^5] The analysis of work
programs and the information on funded projects is placed in the broader
context of the EU\'s evolving technology policy landscape, and its
continued and recently reiterated reliance on digital innovation as a
pillar of economic competitiveness and progress. The report challenges
the assumption that increased investment in \"disruptive technologies\"
is the best way to achieve EU digital sovereignty. It highlights the
risks of current funding strategies being technology-driven rather than
need-based, while following hype cycles rather than credible technology
assessments. Based on these findings, it provides recommendations on how
EU R&I funding can be more effectively aligned with the public interest
to reduce dependency on non-EU digital infrastructure and enhance
digital sovereignty.

## Shifting Landscape for EU Tech Policy

In 2025, the European Union finds itself navigating a multipolar
international landscape. The global tech sector is dominated by the
United States and China, positioning the EU in a competitive struggle to
maintain its technological sovereignty. During the last term of the
European Parliament, the EU institutions adopted several pieces of
legislation to gain more influence over digital tools and services that
have become deeply embedded in European societies and markets. Laws such
as the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act (DMA) have
been key efforts to give Europe more control over its digital
landscape.he DSA focused on making online spaces safer and ensuring that
platforms respect users\' rights. The DMA challenged the dominance of
big tech \'gatekeepers\' to create fairer and more competitive digital
markets. These regulatory measures are part of the EU\'s strategy to
strengthen its technological sovereignty, including digital sovereignty,
as reflected in the appointment of Henna Virkkunen as Executive
Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security, and Democracy following
the 2024 European elections. As pointed out by Mario Draghi,[^6]
enhancing the EU\'s competitiveness requires strategic autonomy in key
sectors and reducing dependencies on external actors. This involves
coordinated policy actions as well as investment in research and
innovation.

## EU's bet on digital technologies

In the EU, industrial policy has traditionally been carried out at
national level. While member states have taken the lead in shaping their
industrial strategies, the EU\'s role has primarily centered on
completing the single market and fostering research and innovation. The
EU Single Market has been seen as the main instrument to ensure
competitiveness, productivity growth, and prosperity, while framework
research programs such as Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe have been
designed to help Europe produce world-class science and technology that
drives economic growth.[^7] In recent years, the EU has seen a
significant rise in supra- and cross-national industrial policy
initiatives, with the European Commission playing a more active role in
pan-European efforts to drive innovation and economic growth. This shift
has been largely driven by changes in the international political
economy, particularly climate challenges, technological advancements,
and geopolitical shifts, which have highlighted the need for a more
integrated and coordinated industrial policy within the single
market.[^8]

Since its introduction in the European Commission\'s 2010 industrial
policy strategy, the Digital Agenda has steadily gained prominence,
becoming a central theme in subsequent strategies.[^9] In 2025, the EU
is once again betting on digital technologies to regain competitiveness.
In the mission letter to Henna Virkkunen, the President of the European
Commission stated that digital technologies are at the heart of
Europe\'s "progress and ambitions." The letter mentioned the need to
intensify efforts and investments concerning the next wave of frontier
technologies, including several digital technologies such as
"supercomputing, semiconductors, and the Internet of Things."

According to the former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi,
Europe must accelerate innovation and identify new \"growth engines.\"
Digital technologies are expected to become drivers of economic growth

> *"With the world now on the cusp of another digital revolution,
> triggered by the spread of artificial intelligence (AI), a window has
> opened for Europe to redress its failings in innovation and
> productivity and to restore its manufacturing potential." -- The
> Future of European Competitiveness ("The Draghi report"), Part A, p.
> 6.*

Overall, Europe\'s ambition for economic competitiveness puts research,
innovation, and digital technologies at the forefront. Such an ambition
may be turned into action when it is translated into budgetary
commitments. The opportunity for doing so comes as the EU\'s future
multiannual budget, set to run from 2028 to 2034, begins to be
negotiated.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|                                                                       |
| The long-term EU budget, the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF),   |
| determines the spending limits across key policy areas. The MFF is    |
| usually adopted for seven years. The MFF negotiation process begins   |
| with the European Commission, which drafts the MFF proposal based on  |
| economic forecasts, policy goals, and input from stakeholders,        |
| including EU institutions, national governments, and civil society.   |
| The MFF is adopted by the Council with the consent of the European    |
| Parliament.                                                           |
|                                                                       |
| Even after the MFF is locked in, the EU's budget isn't set in stone.  |
| Every year, policy makers negotiate and adopt annual budgets within   |
| the MFF limits. A mid-term review (typically halfway through the      |
| budget period) allows the EU to tweak spending plans based on new     |
| challenges. The current MFF (2021-2027) introduced new financial      |
| tools, such as the NextGenerationEU recovery fund, showing how the EU |
| can adapt its budget to unexpected challenges                         |
|                                                                       |
| In terms of how the EU budget is structured, some                     |
| [[reports]{.underline}](https://www.politico.eu/articl                |
| e/european-commission-budget-economic-reforms-conditions-power-grab/) |
| suggested that ahead of the new MFF, the Commission is going back to  |
| the drawing board and considering various options, including          |
| \"merging a dozen different pots of money for research, defense, and  |
| innovation into a single European Competitiveness Fund." This would   |
| be a significant shift from the current approach. According to the    |
| leaked document, which outlines an idea for how the budget could be   |
| restructured, the idea behind the Competitiveness Fund is to address  |
| the weaknesses of the current set-up, in particular, the "complexity  |

## Funding for R&I in digital technologies

Government-led initiatives and funding have historically been essential
in developing digital infrastructures and foundational technologies,
including the Internet. The neoliberal shift in the late 20th century
emphasized reducing state intervention in the economy and increasing
reliance on market mechanisms for providing goods and services. This
shift resulted in the deregulation and privatization of key
infrastructures, including digital infrastructure, initially affecting
the telecommunications sector, which was responsible for providing
internet access. Currently, the majority of internet service providers
are privately owned, while some countries provide state-funded
connectivity in public areas, and only a limited number of networks are
operated by local communities.[^10] Some of the most profound impacts of
the neoliberal shift on the digital economy emerged in the early 21st
century with the development of digital services built on top of the
privatized networks. As a result, digital infrastructure and services
became increasingly controlled by private corporations, shaping the
modern digital economy.

Despite this shift in the economy, government funding has remained a
cornerstone of research and innovation. As Mariana Mazzucato observes,
everything smart about our smartphones has been government-funded.[^11]
The EU has also invested substantial resources into the development and
roll-out of digital technologies, although comparatively less than

the US and China. For example, EU firms represent only 7 percent of R&D
expenditure among leading software and internet companies, compared to
71 percent for the US and 15 percent for China. In technology hardware
and electronic equipment, the EU accounts for 12 percent of R&D
expenditure, while the US accounts for 40 percent and China for 19
percent.[^12] The EU invests in digital technologies through several
large-scale programs, including substantial parts of Horizon Europe
(HE), the Digital Europe program, and the Connecting Europe Facility -
Digital. However, questions remain about their effectiveness in
addressing Europe\'s digital lag.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The Draghi report has been a prominent source of criticism of the EU's
approach to research, innovation, and digital competitiveness,
identifying several challenges that must be addressed to strengthen
Europe's position in the global economy.

One of the report's main concerns is that EU funding for research and
innovation is spread too thin across too many fields, limiting its
impact. Additionally, overall investment levels remain too low. The
report also highlights a disconnect between EU-level initiatives and
national innovation strategies, leading to inefficiencies and missed
opportunities. A more coordinated approach between member states and EU
institutions is needed to maximize resources, avoid duplication, and
create a stronger, unified push for technological leadership. Draghi
places a lot of faith in the potential of "advanced" and "disruptive"
(see next section) technologies to improve Europe's position in the
global economy.

In addition to general innovation challenges, the report highlights
Europe\'s limited capacity in the field of software for communication
devices, which has led to a situation where European citizens and
businesses rely primarily on non-EU services and products. It points to
the fact that no European company has a significant share of the global
communications software market, leaving the EU vulnerable to external
dependencies. We see here how issues of competitiveness and sovereignty
intersect. To address this, the report calls for strengthening Europe\'s
capabilities across the technology value chain, from hardware and
software to digital service platforms. As Draghi states:

> *\"It is essential to restore the security of supply chains for
> critical technologies by strengthening the EU\'s capabilities and
> assets across the value chain in terms of end products and service
> platforms.\"*

The EU must:

> *"deliver state-of-the-art communication services to its citizens and
> businesses provided by strong and successful EU companies, which are
> not overdependent on critical equipment and software providers from
> outside the EU*."

Several other reports have raised concerns similar to those of Draghi,
including a report from an independent group of experts tasked by the
Commission with assessing the "effectiveness, efficiency, relevance,
coherence and European added value" of European research funding.
Inefficiencies in research and innovation programs are said to pose a
barrier to advancing innovation across Europe. Critics argue that
misalignment between R&I and industrial policies weakens the
effectiveness of public investments and hampers the EU's ability to
translate research breakthroughs into industrial competitiveness.
According to Draghi, tackling these inefficiencies is critical for the
EU to build a "competitive edge" and support its economic ambitions.

As the negotiations of the new EU budget are underway, the Commission is
expected to take action and address these concerns. Regardless of how
the next MFF is structured, before committing financial resources to
newly designed funds for R&I and digital transformation, it is essential
to continue the critical assessment of the current structures. Below are
three lessons from our analysis of the current framework for financing
digital transformation from public EU funds. These findings challenge
the prevailing narrative that Europe must \"catch up\" by investing
heavily in the next big innovation to overcome past shortcomings.
Instead, they point to the importance of prioritizing strategic
investments that address current problems to reduce digital
dependencies.

# Three lessons on the EU's funding for the digital R&I

## Lesson one: There is a fixation on the promise of \"disruptive technologies\".

Draghi's report makes the point that in Europe, support for breakthrough
disruptive innovation remains limited and that Europe lags in digital
areas such as "artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, the Internet
of Things (IoT), blockchain, and quantum computing." The report suggests
a fundamental reassessment of budget allocations, recommending that the
percentage of funding for disruptive innovation should be increased to
address the shortcomings of the existing funding allocation, which
currently targets incremental progress and is overly focused on
addressing capital market imperfections. Similarly, the independent
expert group referred to in the previous section emphasizes the need to
stimulate "disruptive research and innovation" in Europe, particularly
in light of the rise of technologies like generative AI that are
reshaping the context of EU research and development policy. They note
that other emerging technologies, such as quantum technologies,
synthetic biology, and cellular technologies, are reaching a level of
maturity where their transformative potential is becoming clearer.

The term "disruptive innovation" was popularized by Clayton Christensen
in the 1997 book "The Innovator's Dilemma". Christensen defined
"disruptive innovation" as the process by which a smaller company, often
with limited resources, successfully competes against a well-established
business (referred to as an "incumbent") by starting at the lower end of
the market and gradually advancing into higher market segments.
Christensen favored the term "disruptive innovation" over "disruptive
technology" because he believed that most technologies themselves are
not inherently disruptive or sustaining. Instead, he argued that it is
the business model that harnesses key ideas to drive significant market
success and act as the catalyst for disruption.

The Draghi report\'s enthusiasm for disruptive innovation as a solution
to economic stagnation stems from the realization that failing to lead
in this area could result in (further) long-term dependence on foreign
technologies. Draghi more than once highlights that Europe failed to
capitalize on the first digital revolution, where US and Chinese firms
quickly outpaced their European counterparts, and risks missing out on
the current and future ones. Hence, now it must "redress its failings".

This focus on technological disruption should be met with caution and a
healthy dose of skepticism. History has shown that the promise of
radical innovation often overshadows the challenges of governance and
the risk of unintended consequences. A prime example is the rise of
social media, once celebrated as a tool for global connection and free
expression, but now recognized for its profound and often detrimental
impacts on society and democracy.

Moreover, while categories such as "artificial intelligence" and
"quantum technology" are frequently cited as examples of disruptive
innovation, they are so broad that they encompass an array of potential
solutions. For example, AI is not a single technology, but a broad field
(that has been developing for decades). Within that broad field, some
advancements, like large language models (LLMs) and computer vision, are
already transforming industries, while others, such as AI-driven
scientific discovery remain in early development. Much of today\'s AI
development that catches policy makers' attention is controlled by a few
large technology companies, reinforcing rather than disrupting existing
market dominance. Quantum technology can refer to anything from quantum
computing to quantum cryptography, making it difficult to determine
which areas should be or are meant to be prioritized for funding and
research. Labeling an entire category as \"disruptive\" can be
misleading, as some innovations in these areas may transform industries
in the near term, while others may never reach commercial viability.
Understanding these nuances is key to developing sensible policy and
investment strategies that focus on technological breakthroughs that
have the potential to produce public value, not just hype or buzzwords.
As a result, it is difficult to determine what the call to \"invest in
disruptive technologies\" means beyond conveying a sense of urgency and
the need for (disruptive) change necessary to \"turn things around\" for
the European market.

Disruption is not inherently positive. While some technological shifts
create new markets and opportunities, others can destabilize industries,
eliminate jobs, or reinforce existing corporate monopolies. Without
precision, the call to invest in \"disruptive technologies\" risks
becoming more of a rhetorical device than a concrete strategy, leaving
room for inconsistent policies and misaligned funding priorities. Some
disruptive technologies can yield benefits, but an overreliance on them
risks neglecting the established practices and institutions essential
for societal well-being. Relevant in this context are the insights of
authors such as Lee Vinsel and Andrew L. Russell, who argue in *The
Innovation Delusion* that the obsession with innovation often
overshadows the critical work of maintaining and improving existing
systems. While disruptive technologies are seen as transformative, they
almost always depend on a strong base of existing infrastructure to
succeed. The focus on tech solutions overshadows the fact that whether
the roll-out of new and disruptive technologies is considered beneficial
depends on the context and perspective.

Finally, a closer examination of funding allocations under existing work
programs reveals that some technology fields considered "disruptive"
already receive a substantial share of resources. Taking the Draghi
report's list of digital technologies in which support supposedly lags
(AI, cybersecurity, IoT, blockchain, and quantum), in the Horizon
program, 20.44% of all analyzed projects have been assigned a keyword
related to one or more of these categories (this is less than the sum of
the percentage of these five categories combined as some projects are
related to multiple "disruptive" categories). These projects received a
total of €8.80 billion, or 23.91% of the program budget allocated at the
time of our analysis (see Figure 2).[^15] The issue, therefore, may not
be a lack of funding for these fields but rather the fragmented and
uncoordinated nature of the funding itself. European research and
innovation funding is spread across many programs and initiatives, often
with overlapping objectives. As a result, resources are diluted across
many small projects, making it difficult to achieve the scale and impact
needed to drive real technological change. The average funding for one
project is €2.69 million and is distributed over an average of 6.4
organizations. The average funding per project lies a little higher for
the subset of digital technologies with the exception of quantum (see
Figure 3).

program (*total*) and the categories *AI, Cybersecurity, IoT,
Blockchain* and *Quantum*.

## Lesson two: The approach to innovation is focused on industry demands, with too little direct connection to real, on-the-ground needs and everyday experiences

A second takeaway from the analysis of current work programs and funding
allocations for digital technologies is that the vision for digital
transformation remains predominantly industry-centric and
technology-driven. For example, within Horizon Europe\'s Cluster 4
funding, which targets the \"Digital, Industry and Space\" sectors, only
one of the 25 most funded projects focuses on developing solutions that
could directly benefit the public.[^16] The remaining 24 projects
overwhelmingly support the development of solutions by and mostly for
industry, such as new production capabilities or advanced space
technologies. And while supporting industry aligns with the cluster\'s
objectives, the imbalance is significant. It is notable that projects
related to keywords in the *Public* category (including public services,
but also policy and elections) form the 4th most funded group in the
Horizon program (see Figure 4 in the appendix). However, the findings
from the in-depth textual analysis of the 25 highest-funded projects in
Cluster 4 suggest that the actual public benefits of projects in this
category may be less clear than claimed, even though substantiating this
claim would require further investigation.[^17]

This industry-centric approach to funding points to a disconnect between
research and innovation funding and the everyday needs of people in
Europe, making the digital solutions that are developed as a result of
industrial policy less relevant and accessible. As a result, this
approach risks subsidising solutions in search of problems rather than
addressing the current challenges of the digital landscape, which are
abundant.

When research and innovation are primarily driven by technological
capabilities rather than societal or user needs, the result is a
mismatch between what is being developed and what is truly needed. For
example, in the Digital Europe program, a call for projects to develop
\"VR/AR worlds\" for local communities explicitly states that the
specific use cases for the technology to be developed have yet to be
defined. Rather than relying on the assessment of areas where technology
would be beneficial, this approach begins with the presumption that
VR/AR is inherently valuable and seeks to retrofit these technologies
into community contexts.

The EU programs contain multiple examples of this approach. \"Developing
CitiVerse\" aims to build digital twins of cities, but the program
description lacks a clear rationale for why local governments and
residents need these immersive environments or how they will integrate
with existing urban management tools. \"Towards Networked Local Digital
Twins in the EU\" proposes an ecosystem of interconnected virtual city
models, yet it remains unclear whether municipalities have expressed a
demand for such technology or if it is being developed for its own sake.

The EU Blockchain Services Infrastructure is developed with the aim of
supporting the EU Digital Identity Wallet and other digital
identity-related use cases. The program outlines that blockchain will be
assessed for its potential value rather than establishing clear,
pressing needs that blockchain would address. As far as AI is concerned,
the program aims to promote the adoption of AI technologies in Europe,
including the development of an ecosystem to facilitate the adoption and
wide usage of AI by businesses. While some AI systems have potential
benefits, a primary focus on adoption and usage, rather than addressing
specific needs or problems, could lead to the implementation of AI
solutions where they are not necessarily the most appropriate or
effective choice.

### Horizon Europe data

According to the data we have analyzed, under Horizon Europe:
   
-   152 projects are related to the broader category of Extended
    Reality (*XR*). They received €511.48 million (1.39% of the 
    Horizon budget allocated at the time of analysis).
-   224 projects are related to Digital Twins. They received €1.32
    billion (3.59%).
-   44 projects are related to Blockchain. They received €216.96
    million (0.59%).
-   2003 projects are related to AI. They received €6.65 billion
    (18.05%).

——————————————————————————————————

This technology-driven approach to innovation that overemphasizes
high-tech solutions at the expense of practical utility and societal
relevance makes the program vulnerable to the hype around new
technologies and their hypothetical promises, a point we will come back
to. It leads to the development of complex solutions that may be
impressive from a technological standpoint but overlook simpler, more
immediate needs that could be addressed through less fancy means, such
as secure, community-driven online platforms or cloud solutions that
empower people and free them from dependence on big tech. Moreover, the
idea that citizens will adopt and thrive in these \"immersive\" digital
environments assumes a level of digital literacy that does not exist. If
the EU aims to support digital transformation that benefits the public,
a shift to needs-driven innovation is needed, where technology is a
means to an end, not an end in itself.

This is supported by the analysis of the project keywords in the Horizon
program. 22.66% of ecMaxContribution goes to projects related to at
least one "disruptive" category (AI, XR, Digital Twins, Blockchain, or
Cybersecurity), but this is only 6.19% for projects that are related to
making technologies more open (keywords related to one or more of the
categories Interoperability, Repairing or Open).[^18] 3.83% of the
ecMaxContribution is given to projects related to Education, but this
includes projects related to education research, pedagogy, technologies
for education, and technology education, so we cannot confidently draw
any conclusions from this number.

most funded projects in Cluster 4.

## Lesson three: EU funding falls for hype and false narratives around new technologies

The third finding from the analysis of work programs and digital funding
allocations is that EU institutions that decide on how to allocate
funding are not immune to the hype and the promise surrounding new
digital technologies. Several funding opportunities under the Digital
Europe program described in the previous section illustrate this
tendency. While investing in untested novel technologies can drive
innovation, an analysis of work programs reveals a susceptibility to
technology hype. In such cases, work programs prioritize the perceived
potential and promise of technology, often fueled by optimism, industry
narratives, or competitive pressures, over concrete evidence and
societal needs.

Cluster 4 of the Horizon Europe program also offers a good illustration
of this phenomenon. Within this Cluster, funding opportunities are
grouped under several thematic focus areas called Destinations. Each
destination is designed to address a particular challenge, such as the
need for "a human-centered and ethical development of digital and
industrial technologies," for example. While this structure aims to
align funding with EU's policy priorities, once these broad goals are
translated into concrete funding opportunities (known as "topics"), the
descriptions frequently overlook critical questions about whether the
proposed technologies can realistically fulfill their promises and bring
the EU closer to the set objective.[^19] Instead, they echo popular,
often overly optimistic narratives about technology's transformative
potential.

For example, the program assumes that 6G networks will be a
game-changer, offering terabit capacity and \"sub-millisecond response
times\" that will enable real-time automation and augmented reality
applications. However, with 5G adoption still incomplete and facing
challenges in deployment, infrastructure costs, and actual consumer
demand, the rush to 6G--projects related to 6G technology (€72.82
million) receive more than three times the funding than projects related
to 5G (€21.08 million)--seems premature and may reflect a desire to
participate in a technology race rather than address a need.

The reference to an \"Internet of Senses\" a concept that envisions
immersive digital experiences that incorporate touch, taste, and smell
further illustrates the speculative nature of some of the investments.
While extended reality technologies have applications in some fields,
such as gaming, education or arts, the assumption that people want or
need fully immersive sensory Internet experiences remains highly
speculative. A needs-based approach would have to account for the reason
that in contrast to previous hype-cycles of Virtual Reality
technologies, this time around social transformation and popular culture
have caught up with real-world applications of immersion.

Another example of an unrealistic belief in the potential of technology
can be found in the topic \"AI for Human Empowerment.\" In this case,
the expected impact includes fostering "interaction and collaboration
between humans and AI systems, working together as partners to achieve
common goals, sharing mutual understanding and learning of each other's
abilities and respective roles." Even this short excerpt illustrates how
deep the phenomenon of AI anthropomorphism[^20] is present in these
programs. The text refers to humans and AI systems working together as
\"partners,\" even though a partner is typically someone who shares
responsibilities, goals, and benefits with another. By using this term,
the text suggests that AI systems can take on roles and responsibilities
similar to those of a human partner. The phrase \"achieve common goals\"
implies that AI systems have a level of agency or intentionality to work
toward goals, a characteristic typically associated with humans (or
other animals with higher cognitive functions), while the phrase \"share
mutual understanding\" suggests that AI systems are capable of
understanding in the same way that humans are. The real risks of
implementing AI solutions, such as taking away people\'s
livelihoods,[^21] are lost in this vision.

While mentions of trustworthy AI and human autonomy are often included
in the descriptions of the topics, a close reading reveals that they
function more as add-ons that check boxes rather than address the actual
concerns. Furthermore, only 3.93% of projects in the AI category also
are related to *Trust* and only 0.54% are related to *Sovereignty*
(which includes autonomy). This shows that while these issues may be
mentioned in the description of many topics, they are a main aspect of
only a small subset of these projects.

By buying into a particular narrative about AI and failing to critically
consider at a deeper level the societal and economic implications of
integrating AI into the workplace, for example, these programs risk
pandering to a naive techno-solutionist and techno-determinist mindset.

# Moving forward

Based on these lessons, we recommend three shifts in approach to guide
EU funding for digital innovation toward more publicly beneficial
outcomes.

***Prioritize public digital infrastructure***

Instead of fixating on \"disruptive technologies\" as a cure-all, the EU
should prioritize strengthening public digital infrastructure (PDI).
While similar to the concept of digital public infrastructure,[^22] PDI
emphasizes the \"public\" aspect, shifting the debate from technical
concerns to its broader social significance. The shift in focus is
particularly crucial as the EU pursues an ambitious industrial policy,
which carries with itself a risk of reinforcing a techno-solutionist
approach to innovation. In this context, PDI refers to digital
infrastructure designed to maximize public value by integrating three
key dimensions: public attributes (ensuring open access and
interoperability), public functions (supporting social and economic
needs for individuals and institutions, including government bodies,
libraries, and museums), and public ownership (involving governmental or
civic participation in its funding, governance, and development, as well
as user control). Drawing on Mariana Mazzucato's insights,[^23] this
expanded understanding of "public" shifts the debate away from purely
technical concerns (digitization) toward its broader societal
significance (public benefit).

Sufficient investment in and support for PDI, from research and
development to deployment and demand creation through public
procurement, would strengthen the EU\'s digital resilience and reduce
dependence on large technology companies and their services. To achieve
this, public funding for digital technologies should adopt a
mission-oriented approach. While the mission-oriented approach is not
new to EU funding,[^24] it has not been widely applied to the funding of
digital technologies, probably because digitization has been seen as a
mission in itself, rather than a tool to achieve other societal goals. A
mission-oriented R&I policy for digital technologies would prioritize
strategic, goal-driven investment, ensuring that digital infrastructure
development aligns with broader economic and social objectives rather
than being shaped solely by market-driven or technological imperatives.

***Align industry support with public value objectives***

Industry support remains an important pillar of European R&D funding.
However, EU decisions on the allocation of public support should
prioritize solutions that meet public needs and reduce dependencies on
corporate service providers that exploit user data, enforce lock-ins,
and prioritize profit maximization, rather than focusing on speculative,
technology-driven approaches. Programs such as the Next Generation
Internet (NGI) aim to foster open-source and interoperable alternatives
to big tech products and services. Yet, these initiatives, in their
current limited scope, are insufficient to reduce the EU\'s current
dependence on non-EU digital technologies. On top of this, the EU has
yet to fully leverage its purchasing power, e.g., through procurement,
to drive demand for non-big tech digital products. By continuing to rely
on American tech giants for digital products and services, the EU does
the opposite and undermines its own stated goals of promoting European
alternatives and digital sovereignty.

In the current changing geopolitical context, the ideas of public needs,
values, or interests will increasingly be defined in terms of security
and militarization. As funding priorities shift toward addressing
security concerns, this refocusing should not overshadow other critical
public needs. The concept of \"public need\" must entail empowering
individuals and ensuring that everyone can enjoy their fundamental
rights both offline and online. Public funding should support projects
that prioritize these rights and enhance people\'s ability to
participate fully in society rather than simply reinforcing a
security-driven agenda. For example, ensuring protection from
surveillance should be considered a public need and a condition for
receiving public funding.

***Adopt a more critical approach to tech in funding***

Prioritizing emerging technologies, such as 6G networks, ideas such as
the \"Internet of Senses,\" and speculative visions of AI, reflects a
commitment to technological advancement that overlooks questions about
the actual benefits these technologies do or do not deliver. The
analysis of the funding allocations shows a pattern where
decision-makers are often swayed by the hype surrounding new digital
technologies, leading to investments in areas where the applications
remain unclear.

EU support for digital transformation must be rooted in a critical
assessment of the potential and promise of new technologies, as well as
assumptions and narratives surrounding them. While high-level objectives
such as \"AI for human empowerment\" are compelling in theory, they tend
to obscure the complexities of technology implementation and the harms
that can result from its use in real life. A more balanced narrative
about technology\'s potential and limits would help avoid uncritical
techno-solutionism and focus on solutions that address the need for a
secure, sovereign, and non-extractive digital environment.

Overcoming unwarranted techno-optimism requires a more nuanced
understanding of the technologies being funded, one that critically
assesses their real potential to address societal challenges rather than
subscribing to speculative promises. To avoid EU funding falling into
the trap of hype, it is essential to involve a wide range of
stakeholders, including public sector representatives, academics, and
civil society organizations, in setting funding priorities and drafting
work programs.

<!-- ## Introduction -->

<!-- Today's world-wide web is powered by the original open web protocols, overlaid with proprietary platforms that often place private interests over public interest.  This has an adverse impact on trust, competition, and democratic values.  Ford Foundation, New America's Digital Impact and Governance Initiative, and Microsoft – the leading organisations in the Missing Layers collaborative – have described this condition as the case of missing layers of a digital ecosystem that is people-centric, functions as a digital commons, and is enabled by open protocols. -->

<!-- The Missing Layers collaborative aims to “develop an actionable vision for digital technology to counter present harms and chart a path towards a jointly designed and shared digital infrastructure that can enable a democratic technology ecosystem.”  The group has identified four areas where this vision of open protocols combined with public interest governance could be applied: data sharing, communication, identity control, and payments. -->

<!-- The collaborative focuses on governance, understood as a combination of government regulation, participatory processes, and competitive innovation in digital ecosystems. One of the goals of this collaborative is also to seek designs that build on the principle of openness to balance innovation with the protection of fundamental values. -->

<!-- The round-table on "Protocols, standards, ecosystems" was organised by Open Future and the critical infrastructure lab as part of the process to develop the Missing Layers framework. We were interested in contributing to the Missing Layers conversation with a perspective of European public interest advocates.  We wanted to take into account the specificity of the European context, where digital ecosystems are increasingly subject to government regulation, aimed at securing some of these public interest goals. -->

<!-- Our aim was to explore how the principles of sovereignty and interoperability can be secured through protocol governance and how the two principles interact.  What kind of sovereign powers and forms of interoperability do we need?  And how does protocol and standards governance interplay with legislative measures? -->

<!-- Through this conversation, we also aimed to identify areas where the vision of a democratic technology ecosystem can be brought to life.  We want to identify principles and elements of a policy program that can serve as a long-term reference point for public interest advocacy and European policymakers. -->

<!-- ## Protocols and power -->

<!-- ### Infrastructural ideologies and network paradigms -->

<!-- The critical infrastructure lab published a draft report to discuss at the event, ^[[https://www.criticalinfralab.net/uploads/2023/07/missingreport.pdf](https://www.criticalinfralab.net/uploads/2023/07/missingreport.pdf)] introducing a framework to study protocols, standards and governance.  The framework defines three network paradigms that describe how power is exercised differently through differently engineered and governed networks.  The three network paradigms are the Internet (“open internetworking”), GSM (“cellular mobility”) and 5G (“smart networks”). -->

<!-- Potential users of these networks need to be enrolled as *actual* users of the networks.  The framework defines infrastructural ideologies as a strategically deployed set of narratives and metaphors, ^[More precisely referred to as “sociotechnical imaginaries” in Science and Technology Studies.] engineering principles and material constraints, ^[The so-called “infrastructural effects”.] as well as governance structures ^[For example, the standards bodies and their standardisation processes.] and political-economic incentives.  All these very different constituents of infrastructural ideologies are deployed in order to legitimise the network as a rational solution and justify users’ reliance on it.  In order to do so, infrastructural ideologies highlight some aspects of the network functions in order to leave other aspects out of the limelight.  The infrastructural ideology gives users good reason to be users, that is to say to subject themselves to the regime of power encoded in the infrastructure by occupying the subject positions that it defines.  A successful infrastructural ideology leads to wide adoption and popularity with users, while at the same time serving the vested interests of its instigators. -->

<!-- ### Sovereignty and interoperability -->

<!-- Sovereignty is traditionally defined as the ultimate authority over a territory circumscribed by borders and the subjects that are attached to that territory.  ^[Following German political theorist Carl Schmitt, a prominent member of the Nazi party.]  On the one hand, there is a long-standing link between the concept of sovereignty and the military control of a land.  On the other hand, sovereignty is exercised over subjects, who are subjects to the sovereign power.  All in all, sovereignty today usually refers to the relationship between the modern state, its territory, and its citizenship. -->

<!-- ![Fucino example photo, by ESA](images/image.jpg){width=100% height=100%} -->

<!-- ![Fucino example photo, by ESA](images/image.jpg#fullcolumnwidth) -->

<!-- Modern political and legal theory uses the concept of sovereignty to explain why states can define laws, and to be in some sense above the law themselves.  While sovereignty is the manifestation of human freedom on Earth, it is also what allows states to control their citizens.  Sovereignty is the basis of international relations where nation states face each other nominally as equal (ultimate) powers: -->

<!-- > Sovereignty is a hypothetical trade, in which two potentially (or really) -->
<!-- > conflicting sides, respecting de facto realities of power, exchange such -->
<!-- > recognitions as their least costly strategy. [@Wallerstein1991 44] -->

<!-- ###### This is a fake pulled quote which needs to be longer so we can test the border -->

<!-- Standards and protocols organise space and time to produce subject positions.  Users of the protocol occupy these subject positions, either intentionally or unintentionally.  When they do so, they fall under the regime of power defined by the operation of a protocols stack.  Protocols for authentication have the infrastructural effect to bring transform the user into a subject of a sovereign entity.  From this vantage point, interoperability becomes a question of power. -->

<!-- Interoperability is the property of technologies to work together, so that we can plug any electric appliance into an electric wall socket and the plug would fit. The question of interoperability is even more crucial for communication protocols that connect to systems, in this case any one system is as useful as it is interoperable with another system. Standards are responsible for ensuring interoperability in technologies and protocols are specific to communication. -->

<!-- ![Fucino](images/image.jpg#fullpagewidth) -->

<!-- Interoperability is thus a way to extend the reach and scope of a protocol stack throughout the infrastructure, enrolling users into its regime of power, but also to negotiate the entanglements of power between different sovereignities.  Even though interoperability allows interconnection in communication protocols, the real question is on whose terms does interconnection happens.  At different points in history, the United States, and European nation states were in this position to define the terms of interconnection, when they introduced the network paradigm of open internetworking and cellular mobility.  At this historical moment, the burning question of the day is whether China’s bid to do the same with the 5G protocols stack could work, and with what consequences. -->

<!-- ## Identity -->

<!-- ### Case studies of identity protocols -->

<!-- Two case studies were presented at the round-table, applying the proposed framework to contrast two authentication protocols: OpenID and Aadhaar.  These protocols represent very different approaches to digital identity, from their problem definitions to their threat models.  What we learn from comparing them is that a digital identity protocol is as useful and powerful as the sovereignty that is backing it up. -->

<!-- OpenID: -->

<!-- : is a weak identity protocol by design, targeting a global market of digital services.  It allows a user to log in to a web service using credentials registered at with another web service.  Thus, users can choose their identity providers based on trust and convenience, and use that identity to access interoperable services without registering with them separately. -->

<!-- > The large OpenID players in terms of the standardisation process and the adoption of the protocols are drawn from the ranks of US Silicon Valley capital, including the famous digital platform monopolies (GAFAM -- Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft).  Philosopher of technology Benjamin Bratton [-@Bratton2015] claims that these companies acquired some aspects of sovereignty that are comparable to nation states.  Bratton’s provocative idea was that corporations, not just nation states, can be sovereign.  The idea gained traction in the last few years, when governments subjected these companies to increased scrutiny and regulation in the EU, the US, and elsewhere.  ^[Notably, they have been tightly regulated in China since their entry to that market, which has been precisely the reason for their exit from that market, creating the opportunity for national champions to take their place.]  Rather than any perceived issue with content moderation, democratic oversight, procedural transparency, market competition, user data, surveillance practices and privacy policies, what really changed to open the possibility of regulation might have been that nation states actually recognised these companies as one of their own: as fledging sovereign entities operating within their territory.  According to this interpretation, states started regulating platforms because they saw them as challengers to their exclusive powers, e.g. their sovereignty. -->

<!-- > The ideological catch of OpenID is similar to the promise of the open web.  While any capable actor can participate in the market of identity provision, only big players are in the position to take advantage of being identity providers.  Small players can choose whether to participate as interoperable parties that accept OpenID logins, which effectively enrols them as well as their users in the regime of identity established by US capital.  As a result, OpenID adoption steadily fell, reverting back to an ecosystem where its place has been taken over by APIs provided by the same monopolies. -->

<!-- Aadhaar: -->

<!-- : is a strong identity protocol by design, targeting people in India.  It is backed up by the state and only used within its territory, so that the sovereignty in question here is the traditional sovereignty of a nation state.  This is in obvious contrast with OpenID, which targets a global market of web services with platform providers as the sole actors. -->

<!-- > Aadhaar is tied to materiality and the land in various ways.  As a proof of residence, it established its subject as dwelling in the geographical territory of India, and subject to its laws.  Citizens’ biometric data such as retina scans and fingerprints tie this technical and legal identity to the properties of their physical bodies.  The identity is issued as a physical card in addition to database entries and API access.  SIM cards can be connected to the Aadhaar identity as additional networked physical tokens identifying the user. -->

<!-- > Being a strong identity protocol means that Aadhaar can be used for a variety of purposes beyond authenticating with web services.  As critiques have pointed out, the identity protocol acts as a gatekeeper for access to state subsidies, health care, bank loans and everyday purchases, ultimately allowing or constraining the exercise of civil and consumer rights.  The power of the protocol to establish interoperability between public and private service provision have itself been the target of controversies. -->

<!-- These examples warrant observations about the interaction of sovereignty and identity.  Such reflections are especially pertinent in light of the initiative to establish a European digital identity (eIDAS).  In particular, the European idea is to separate a “trusted and secure e-ID” ^[<https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/trusted-and-secure-european-e-id-regulation>] from a future “digital euro” as a “complement to cash”.    ^[<https://finance.ec.europa.eu/digital-finance/digital-euro_en>]  The approach is designed to avoid both the weak identity of OpenID that only works with web services and the over-powerful identity of Aadhaar that crosses the line between commercial markets and public services.  Still, interoperability will be a key concern given the limited administrative integration and extensive sovereign powers of European nation states.  As with other recent innovative European digital policies such as Gaia-X and the AI Act, certification for compliance and interoperability will play a major role.  Digital rights advocates and civil society actors should follow the process of eIDAS and the digital euro closely and take clues from the experience of previous identity protocols in interventions to safeguard the public interest. -->

<!-- ### Structure and agency in standards bodies -->

<!-- The framework shows a neat picture of sovereign actors projecting their power through the development, implementation and deployment of standards and protocols, even whole network paradigms, which are adopted by users who subject themselves to the power of these sovereigns because they are convinced by their infrastructural ideologies. -->

<!-- The real process is much more complex, laiden with historical contingencies, path dependencies, and the haphazard agency of engineers as deeply situated actors with quite some distance from the sovereign powers these standards and protocols are supposed to serve.  It would be too simple to assume that participants in standards bodies are fully conscious of the larger interests they serve, or even that they can fully predict the consequences of their technical choices.  These twists and turns have been extensively documented by historians of technology [@Abbate1999; @Hillebrand2001; @Russell2014]. -->

<!-- On the Internet side, participants of the process saw protocol design mainly as struggle against material agency, e.g. getting things to work.  The mandate and funding for the initiative has been provided by government funding through the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), soon renamed simply to Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), reflecting a US doctrine of demilitarising innovation at the end of the Cold War.  Such atmosphere provided much intellectual freedom to participants, who disposed rather freely of their ample funding and made liberal use of the strong research environment.  A case in point is that many Requests for Comments (RFC) that defined the actual protocols have been written and/or implemented by graduate students.  It is entirely plausible that they were largely unaware of, or unconcerned about the geopolitical power struggles in which establishing a new network paradigm would strengthen US hegemony and secure access to a global market. -->

<!-- Attributing an infrastructural ideology to the network paradigm of the Internet may sound like its designers carried out a pre-formulated plan to dupe the world.  However, ideology does not work through individual consciousness, intentionality or agency.  Most engineers who worked on the development, implementation and deployment of early Internet protocols were as much under the influence of its infrastructural ideology as their users in the subsequent decades.  The power of ideology is to define common sense, rationality and the public interest in a way that the ensuing consequences serve partial interests. ^[Corinne Cath, a participant in the round-table and fellow of the critical infrastructure laboratory, diagnoses the same point about the ideology of patriarchy at work in standards bodies   [-@Cath2023].  In her case study of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) — the epitome of open process — it is clear that it is not attendees’ evil intentions, or preconceived plans, that prevent womens’ participation in standardisation on equal grounds to men.  On the contrary, it is exactly that participants spontaneously follow what they take as a common sense approach to valuation and behaviour in the IETF, whose consequences are nonetheless detrimental to women’s contributions.]  That the individual historical actors in standards bodies are experiencing their contributions and their difficulties as spontaneous, contingent and practical, is nothing else but the very proof of the successful performance of an ideology. -->

<!-- The idea of the market is a case in point.  The market plays an important role in US common sense about the public interest, such as in providing consumers a free choice for exercising their purchasing powers, and innovators a medium to offer products and services to those consumers.  In such a capacity, the market is a key component in the ideology of the American Dream, a trope familiar to citizens and would-be citizens of the country.  ^[And due to the cultural imperialist strategy of the US, to an increasingly global audience as well.]  While this is not a very original argument, it may account for the reason why US engineers working on the early Internet may find it common sense to design protocols that distribute power in the manner of markets. -->

<!-- But what happens after an ideology is inscribed in a protocol stack, and that protocol stack is canonised as a global network paradigm?  Like the question of individual agency, the cause-effect relationship between protocol design and the projection of political power across borders is an elusive one.  There are good reasons to believe that  open protocols and the open process of standardisation served US interests, market expansion, geopolitical ambitions in the 1990s.  On the one hand, the US government held reigns in the world of Internet Governance, with the US Chamber of Commerce owning the root zone file in which every top level domain is recorded.  ^[The last part of web addresses such as `.net` or `.nl`.]   On the other hand, US capital was in a position to take advantage of the global reach of the online open market and the permissionless innovation enabled by the End-to-End principle enshrined in TCP/IP.  These material conditions cemented US hegemony to some degree, but also created ideological contradictions and path dependencies. -->

<!-- Ideological contradictions meant that the US came under fierce criticism from its partners and enemies for advertising the doctrine of openness and collaboration in the development and governance of the Internet, while keeping control of the most obvious choke point within its underlying infrastructure.  The US gave up its hold on the DNS root zone file on the 1^st^ October, 2016.  Around the same time, East Asian multinational corporations began to appear as viable competitors to US platform monopolies in the lucrative market of online services.  ^[Prominent examples are the Alibaba online marketplace, Sina Weibo social media platform and the super-app WeChat.]  The infrastructural ideology of open internetworking and the protocol design of the TCP/IP stack meant that US state and capital could do little to halt their advance.  Both US incepted material conditions and governance institutions now played to the advantage of foreign actors.  Once the terms of interconnection have been set in the context of a network paradigm, the US could do as much to turn them around as Victor Frankenstein to control the Creature. -->

<!-- ### Structure and agency in user adoption -->

<!-- In this round-table discussion, we look at power and agency from the point of view of standards and protocols, interoperability and sovereignty.  An assumption that comes with the topic is that the grammars defined by standards and protocols for interoperable machine-to-machine communication are as much instruments of power than the software interfaces running on the application layer and the content delivered by the network to end users.  By focusing on low-level technological solutions and their governance mechanisms, we are privileging a bottom-up view of the protocol stack and the social relations it enables and instigates. -->

<!-- Overemphasising the role of the underlying *infra*structures and its infrastructural effects such as interoperability may lead to loosing sight of the real driver behind changes in the ecosystem of protocols and standards: user adoption.  Our discussion is far removed from the perspective of end users who encounter infrastructural assemblages in the situated context of their life-worlds, while they focus their attention on getting mundane things done.  When they do, their technological choices are rarely motivated by an evaluation of governance mechanisms or even technical suitability.  Availability, reliability and convenience drive user adoption. -->

<!-- The example of Apple’s experience design is a case in point.  The free software movement has long been evangelising the adoption of user controlled technologies for political, aesthetic and practical reasons.  In doing do, the free software movement often stood in for the public interest, articulating how technology in the service of users should work.  While hackers have been waiting for the Year of the Linux Desktop ^[Ironically, a subcultural reference to the historical tipping point marking the mass adoption of the GNU/Linux operating system by end users on their personal computers.]  that never comes, Apple championed a vision of technology that is simple and functional. -->

<!-- The point is that for most end users, the accessibility that Apple marketed proved to be more substantial than the promises of the free software movement.  Apple focused its offering on the surface layer of the stack because that is where end users make their choices.  The free software movement lost out because it has put the bulk of its efforts into improving the underlying infrastructure-level technologies rather than the associated user interfaces. -->

<!-- The moral of the story is that the popularity, and, by extension, the power of protocols largely depends on which user interfaces and user-facing services choose to integrate them.  ^[Cf. the discussion on user agents at the end of the “Challenges to open standard setting” section.] -->

<!-- ## Interoperability -->

<!-- Interoperability is a principle that get constantly repeated in discussions about a more democratic internet. One that secures the goals of market competition, but which also brings with it greater innovation in services, and a chance for more society-centric solutions. In Europe, a range of interoperability mandates was or is in the process of being introduced - making it possible to discuss how state regulation enables the creation of interoperable ecosystems.  -->

<!-- ### Interoperability mandates are an enabling force -->

<!-- There are signs that online ecosystems are shifting back to decentralised solutions, after a period of centralisation around the major platforms. And while interoperability is often mentioned as an important principle, it is hard to imagine Big Tech to create interoperable solutions on their own. The case of messaging interoperability rules and the Matrix protocol show how regulation can enable market change, if coupled with sufficient capacity to implement alternative, interoperable solutions.  -->

<!-- Matrix is an open standard for secure, decentralised communication that aims to create an open communication layer on the web, to break communication silos. The messaging networks built on this protocol have 100 million individual users - many of them through governments or enterprises that adopted  the standard. Matrix has been created in 2014, and observed significant growth whenever dominant communication networks have been failing to meet user expectations - such as when changes were made to WhatsApp's privacy policies.  -->

<!-- Yet it is state regulation that is the real enabler of interoperable messaging. Matrix is expected to further grow when the Digital Market Act's interoperability requirements go into force, at the start of 2024. The act requires large online platforms and corporations to make their messaging services interoperable. The new law has legitimised the approach taken by Matrix. The protocol, and services built on top of it, prove at the same time that interoperable, decentralised messaging is possible.  -->

<!-- Regulation cannot force anyone to use interoperable services - they are an enabler for work done by creators of services that are alternatives to the dominant ones. There also need to be actors - businesses or non-profits - that are able to create these interoperable services. More broadly, this is a question of whether there are sufficient capacities and skills to benefit from interoperability - for example, whether there is sufficient technical expertise in public institutions to deploy alternative solutions, instead of simply accepting the offer of the Big Tech companies. Attention also needs to be paid to the design of interfaces - as these have a cultural role that determines adoption of services. Today, Big Tech wields social and cultural power by excelling in the design of interfaces.  -->

<!-- And regulatory action can also have spillover effects - the introduction of the DMA has raised interest of standards bodies, for example IETF has a working group on interoperability of messaging services. -->

<!-- ### Interoperability helps market innovation and sovereignty of users -->

<!-- Interoperability is often discussed solely in terms of market competition.Yet it is a principle that is generative: that can lead to broader shifts in online ecosystems. Interoperability is interesting as it makes dominant services contestable through the creation of new markets. It allows alternatives to be created, and for users to put pressure on services - since in an interoperable space there is always the risk of them switching to other services. -->

<!-- The Open Banking provisions, introduced in the UK, are good example of the impact of interoperability measures. Open Banking has been enforced by the UK Competition and Markets Authority, which forced the nine largest banks to agree on a series of APIs that allow competitors to access data held by these banks, based on the consent of individual customers. While the regulation has not made the banking sector much more competitive, it had a big impact on innovation and helped introduce a broad range of new financial services.  -->

<!-- Interoperability measures also serve to support sovereignty. In the case of public institutions using Matrix-based services, the rationale for adopting Matrix is mainly to control own communication infrastructure. And similarly at individual level, choice can also translate to decisions about having more control over own communications and data.  -->

<!-- ### Next steps for European interoperability policies -->

<!-- While attention of stakeholders has focused on the interoperable messaging mandate, the DMA includes other, specific interoperability obligations for large online platforms - these include rules for virtual assistants or browser search engines. And further, broad rules for data portability will most probably be introduced in the upcoming Data Act. These will reply to Internet of Things services and voice assistants, which will be required to ensure data portability: allowing users to move their data and change services that they are using. The Data Act will also introduce interoperability of cloud services. -->

<!-- We can expect European policymakers to further pursue interoperability measures. As a rule, such measures make less sense for new types of services, for spaces of technological development that are still quickly changing. For this reason, messaging - where the core functionalities are by now clearly defined and shared by many services on the market  - were a good choice for regulation.  -->

<!-- Standardisation is a crucial factor that determines the success of interoperability measures. In the case of Open Banking, banks were forced to agree to technical standards. In the case of the DMA, the proposal to give the European Commission power to nominate technical standards did not pass. Gatekeepers will come up with their own standards, and there are not strong mechanisms in place to ensure that they secure real interoperability, and that they will be followed. -->



<!-- ## Standards -->

<!-- **Standards as an increasingly important mode of governance of technology** -->

<!-- In the 1970s the European Commission faced the challenge of regulating increasingly complex technological systems. And since it lacked the capacity to define the regulation in details, it decided to delegate this task to European standardisation bodies. The standards created by these private companies were formally speaking optional - but in practice companies complied, in order to avoid risks related to the interpretation of the law itself.  -->

<!-- Standard-setting is often framed as a technical activity, conducted away from the political debates taking place in legislative processes. Yet this is not true, and technical standards impact societies - especially when technical systems are increasingly enmeshed with social systems.  -->

<!-- **The case of the European AI Act and the growing role of standardisation** -->

<!-- This regulatory model has been introduced by the European Commission into the Artificial Intelligence Act, which is the first digital regulation to depend so much on standards as regulatory means. And as a result matters related to fundamental rights have been delegated to standardisation bodies. In principle, standardisation is meant to ensure the regulation of high-risk AI applications, in spheres such as health, education, policing or critical infrastructure. Yet the standardisation bodies lack the sectoral expertise, and as a result are drafting standards that look the same across these spheres, and do not take into account their specificity. And there also are limits to creating public interest, society-centric rules through technical standards.  -->

<!-- The AI Act process also shows challenges related to the participation of civil society in the standardisation work. Traditionally, public interest advocates have focused their attention on the legislative process. And they are largely missing from the standardisation bodies, which have already started work on the standards, in parallel with the legislative work. In addition, civil society often lacks the - largely technical expertise - needed to participate in standardisation debates. -->

<!-- This participatory challenge could to some extent be solved by engaging public standards bodies in the process. These bodies provide greater procedural legitimacy, and also ensure openness of the standards themselves - as those created by private standardisation bodies or copyrighted, and often expensive, thus limiting their accessibility. Yet public standardisation bodies will face the same challenges with participation: few actors will have the capacity to engage in the process, and to give it legitimacy. -->

<!-- ### The standardisation bodies, and their four functions -->
 
<!-- There are four private standardisation bodies that are relevant for standard setting of the internet and related technologies: the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) does mainly web standardisation, IEEE focuses on hardware standards,  -->
<!--  Internet Engineering Task Force (together with the Internet Research Task Force and the Internet Architecture Board) deals with standardisation of the layers of the internet that are not addressed by W3C or IETF.  -->

<!-- here is also the ITU, the oldest international body that is part of the UN. And while it has been attempting to play a role in internet standardisation, this approach has received a lot of push-back. -->

<!-- Private standardisation bodies do four things: they make standards, they deal with the governance of standard making, they deliberate on principled (as a form of long-term thinking), and they conduct cross-cutting research work and knowledge building.  -->

<!-- The deliberation on principles is well visible in the IETF's work on AI standards. The Task Force published a document that outlined the principles for human rights focused AI development - and this framing was the result of successful advocacy of a small group of civil society actors. Alternative principles that were proposed aimed at watering down these principles - which ultimately turned out to have direct impact on standardisation processes.  -->

<!-- ### Structures for participatory standard setting -->

<!-- The composition of the different bodies determines to what extent their process is participatory, and structures the possibility of civil society engagement in these processes. Both W3C and IEEE are membership driven. And the ITU stands out due to the fact that it is heavily state driven. In the last case, this means that the ITU has been doing important work on enabling broader access, especially through its Development Sector.  -->

<!-- And of all these four bodies the IETF is the most open, both in terms of document sharing and the participation in the drafting process. For public interest advocates, this openness concerns not just the standardisation process, but also the other elements: work on governance, and on principles. It's easier for civil society to create its own space within the standardisation process. The Public Interest Technology Group at the IETF is an effort to create such space, with impact upon IETF that goes beyond just standards, governance or principles - and the group takes advantage of the fact that IETF is an open forum.  -->

<!-- Efforts to make the IETF process more participatory don't necessarily concern standard setting. There is important work being done through talks and interventions, that provide IETF participants with new perspectives on technology. Similarly, the Global access to the internet for all research group has been established with a similar approach in mind - to shape the broader mindset of IETF stakeholders. -->

<!-- ### Challenges to open standard setting -->

<!-- Fora like the IETF also create space for corporate advocacy. Often a company that is developing a certain technology enters a standards body, and as a result the research and development phase becomes more open. Comments made by stakeholder groups are made public, and legitimised through the IETF process, possibly creating pressure on the company.  -->

<!-- One of the key challenges for standards bodies are incentives that lead stakeholders to participate. The dominant reason today is market domination: parties enter these processes with the hope that a standard will be designed in a way that will enable the given company to dominate the market. While these incentives are working, they do not necessarily serve the public interest. Also, standards bodies lack mechanisms of arbitrating opposing interests of stakeholders.  -->

<!-- While the bodies pay a lot of attention to internal governance, they in turn dismiss the issue of external governance: how they interact with other organisations, or how standards interact with regulation. W3C, if we see it as an international commons regulator, is not good at figuring out its connections with other relevant organisations and governance fora.  -->

<!-- Standardisation work of W3C is contingent on the openness of user agents. Even with open protocols and ensured interoperability, the ecosystem can be captured by dominating the user agent market - which is beyond the scope of governance of these standardisation bodies. One solution to this would be introducing some kind of a fiduciary regime for user agents, which would define legal obligations for actions as the agent of the user, in the user's interest. Dealing with this kind of issues requires bridging gaps between standards bodies and other governance and regulatory bodies.  -->

<!-- ## Action points -->

<!-- The round-table discussion was an opportunity to assess the shifting policy terrain and possible strategies for intervention.  We highlight three points to consider for policy advocates here: -->

<!-- 1. ***Standards bodies*** are delegated an increasing role in European policy making as standards and certification are instrumentalised in regulation in competition and trade, as well as values and norms.  The implementation of the AI Act is a case in point.  Policy advocacy that traditionally targeted policy making needs to shift towards standards in order to influence outcomes. -->

<!-- 2. ***Telecommunication companies*** attempt to diversify their role in digital services from providing access to data and compute provision.  The introduction of smart networks such as 5G are a case in point, as well as the identification of citizens and consumers through mobile phones and SIM cards.  Digital rights activists who traditionally focus on the Internet alone might want to consider widening their focus and perspectives to telecommunications. -->

<!-- 3. The European Parliament elections will result in a ***new European Commission*** to be set up, shifting the balance of power and changing who is in charge of relevant portfolios. -->

<!-- On a more close range tactical level the *Digital Markets Act, AI Act, Data Act, European Digital Identity (eIDAS)* and future *digital euro* processes have been mentioned in the workshop as legislative processes to especially relevant to the public interest in the ecosystem of standards and protocols. -->

<!-- The take-away for learning from European developments such as AI standards is that ***regulating interoperability works***, highlighting the role of sovereign powers in shaping the ecosystem.  European policy has knock-on effects and spill-over to other regions through leading by example, the entanglement of industrial processes, research and development, as well as markets.  Centring people and planet through shifting power to the public interest can increasingly happen through standards development, governance and policy with the input of a strategically aware civil society. -->
